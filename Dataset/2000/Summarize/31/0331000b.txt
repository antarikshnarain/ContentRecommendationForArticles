Terrorism not the way: Gujral

Inaugurating the Neelan Tiruchelvam Commemoration Programme , the former Prime Minister who had earlier proposed ` ` non- reciprocity' ' as a guiding factor in neighbourhood relations , said the region ` ` is presently confronted with some road-blocks , mind-sets , doubts and suspicions,' ' and that the FTA ` ` will serve as a ` technology demonstrator ' illustrating to others the benefit of regional co-operation .
' ' The commemoration programme is being held in memory of Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam , a senior leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) and internationally renowned constitutional expert who was assassinated by a suicide-bomber , suspected to belong to the LTTE in Colombo last July .
Defining regional co-operation as ` ` another term for working towards the realisation of our collective self- interests,' ' Mr . Gujral said , ` ` as men must live and work together within democratic nations , so must we , as democracies , work in close and constructive co-operation within our region .
' ' On the life and contributions of Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam and his ` ` commitment to the people of Sri Lanka- Sinhala , Tamil , Muslim or Burgher,' ' Mr. Gujral said : ` ` in his constitution , Neelan had a place for everyone to live in dignity and freedom in one united harmony .
' ' Messages from the U.N. Secretary General , Mr. Kofi Annan , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , Ms. Mary Robinson and Myanmarese leader , Ms. Aung Saung Su Kyi ( PLS CHECK SPELLING ) , were read out on the occasion .
