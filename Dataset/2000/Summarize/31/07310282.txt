Plenty of lessons to be learnt

One must say that the Indian team put up a pretty good fight in the last league match of the Carlton and United Tri-series .
Australia might have won the keenly contested encounter at Perth , but only after Sachin Tendulkar 's men had tried their best to defend a score of 226 .
His decision to ask off-spinner Dipak Patel to open the bowling clicked , and soon , the other teams had picked up the cue .
In his first match of the tour , but the last game for the Indians , left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi did fairly well .
The team management has to experiment with the resources available if the going is not good , and the move to include Joshi in the eleven came a bit too late in the day .
But at least in the last match , where India stretched the contest till the last over , there was a visible change in the approach and attitude , which were definitely more positive .
