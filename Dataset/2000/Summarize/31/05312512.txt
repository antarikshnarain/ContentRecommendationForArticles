Only the beginning

THE TWO CABINET decisions concerning the public sector disinvestment programme , although differing radically in their scope , methodology and expected price realisation , send out one clear common message : that the government is willing and able to take tough decisions even in an area which has been proving particularly contentious .
The selection of a strategic partner , who will take over the management with a 26 per cent equity stake , will be the litmus test deciding , among others , the valuation of an enterprise which has traditionally been asked to fulfil far more than just commercial goals .
The decision to keep out foreign airlines from bidding for a strategic - even minority - stake and restrict most other types of overseas equity to 40 per cent will surely refocus on the opaqueness of the present civil aviation policy , from which these two apparently irrational conditions have been derived .
The above also indicates clearly that the conventional measures of evaluating a public sector sale such as the price realisation to the government can not be applied immediately at least in the case of IA .
It is also necessary to visualise the post-privatisation scenario and build safeguards both from the point of view of competition and for ensuring civil aviation 's strategic and other non-commercial obligations to the country .
The government 's decision to sell nearly three-fourths of Modern Foods ' equity to Hindustan Lever seems to have been motivated primarily by the prospect of realising almost Rs .
