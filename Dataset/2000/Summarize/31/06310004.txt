Accessing global equity: freedom at a price

The recent decision to ease restrictions on the issue of global depository receipts ( GDRs ) and American depository receipts ( ADRs ) by Indian companies has major implications .
Will the companies and their financial intermediaries such as merchant bankers connected with the raising of capital abroad have a larger perspective ( not just a one shot equity raising exercise ) than they did in 1993-94 when similar procedural freedom existed ?
Another measure of the damage can be gauged by the difficulty subsequent - much better quality - blue chip issuers such as VSNL , GAIL and MTNL - faced in the international markets .
Unethical practices along with downright poor quality of many of the issuers - a few them had no business to be on Indian bourses leave alone on those outside - ensured in a literal sense the devaluation of Indian paper abroad .
Thus , although the reserves are extremely comfortable at $ 35 billion plus and by their very nature the equity offerings ( which the GDRs/ADRs are ) are more stable than say the Euro - borrowings , there are substantial areas where the calculations can go wrong .
Hence , while the latest guidelines take the economy a step forward towards liberalisation , their benefit can be measured only over time and after the issuers and the intermediaries demonstrate that they can combine freedom with the responsibility .
