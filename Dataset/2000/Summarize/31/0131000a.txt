Britain's &#163;10,000 bond for Asians dubbed discriminatory

Visitors to Britain from the Indian subcontinent will have to put up a & # 163 ; 10,000 bond if immigration officials suspect that they intend to settle illegally .
Mr. Jeremy Corbyn , the ruling Labour Party MP for London 's Islington North area , described the scheme as ` ` discriminatory and possibly illegal' ' under race relations laws .
' ' Mr. Ashok Kumar , the Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East in north-east England , said : ` ` I can see no harm in launching a pilot scheme but we will have to evaluate the results very carefully before adopting this .
' ' Mr. Ashika Thanki of the Newham Monitoring Project , a campaigning organisation for ethnic minorities in London , said : ` ` It is noticeable that the Home Office are proposing to run this project on the Asian subcontinent , not in Australia .
' ' The Home Office dismissed this claim , saying only relatively wealthy people could afford the cost of travel and that if the bond was seen to be insignificant it could be viewed simply as the price to be paid for securing entry to the U.K . ` ` The prospective loss of the bond money must be a real incentive to the sponsor to encourage the visitor to abide by his immigration conditions,' ' said a spokesperson .
