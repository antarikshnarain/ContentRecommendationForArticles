Mind can be controlled by meditation

The science of meditation has survived uninterrupted and exhaustive testing as it has passed from generation to generation .
If one can understand its four paths , it is possible to unravel the trappings and mysterious elements of any religious or philosophical system .
The meditator reaches the superconscious level in which he or she is able to identify with the all-Blissful Self , at which stage there is no awareness of body or mind .
` ` Who am I' ' , ` ` What is my purpose in life,' ' ` ` Why do some people seem to have an easier time of life than others' ' and ` ` Where did I come from and where am I going' ' are a few among them just to mention .
The meaning of life can be found only by diving deep , deep within , for which meditation helps as it is the practice by which there is constant observance of the mind , explained Swami Vimalananda in a lecture .
Not one muscle twitched nor did his calm facial expression change because he did not identify with his physical sheath .
