Andre Agassi's dream run continues

If , for Andre Agassi , the last eight months of his career must seem like a dream in which everything happens in slow motion , where everything is just perfect , then the balding 29- year old genius has managed to slam the alarm shut everytime there has been an attempt to wake him up from his reverie .
And the first set surprise was just what Agassi needed , perhaps , to keep on dreaming as he quickly matched the demands of the occasion for a 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-2 , 6-4 victory that gave him not only his second Australian Open title but , more significantly , his third Grand Slam championship in eight months and his sixth major career title ( not counting the Olympic gold at Atlanta ) .
About the only time that Agassi , the first man to play in four successive Grand Slam finals since Rod Laver in 1969 , was rudely shaken off his dream was in the Wimbledon final last summer when the greatest of 'em all produced a virtual tour de force to shut him out in three sets .
Looking back , when he lost in the fourth round of this championship last year to a journeyman called Vincent Spadea in the fourth round , if you had put in $ 100 with TAB Sportsbet for Agassi to win three out of the next four Grand Slam titles , you 'd be the owner of a small fortune today .
To win a Grand Slam title is very special and to do it here , in front of a knowledgeable tennis crowd is even better,' ' said Agassi who , after the presentation , thanked his coach Brad Gilbert and his trainer Gil Reyes but said nothing about the lady who has been courtside for every one of his seven matches here , sharing his highs and lows with him - a certain Steffi Graf .
With his brilliant and remorseless shotmaking , the man from Las Vegas took a firm grip on the match as he confidently served out the third set and then after a brief interlude - a man in black clothes and a face mask jumped in from the crowd and started shooting with a video camera before he was hustled out by the security guards - broke Kafelnikov 's serve for an early lead in the fourth .
