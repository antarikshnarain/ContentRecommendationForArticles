Three-pronged strategy to combat insurgency in Kashmir

Highly placed sources said that a decision had been taken to increase the force level , especially in the Rajouri , Punch , Nangi Tekri , and Sudarbani areas , south of the Pir Panjal ranges .
Besides , the ` ` imbalance' ' caused in the force level , owing to larger post-Kargil deployment along the Line of Control ( LoC ) , resulting in the presence of fewer troops in the insurgent zones in the valley and the Doda area is yet to be ` ` corrected' ' fully .
Security planners feel that in the post-Kargil scenario there is no option but to harden the stance against those who provide sanctuaries to cross-border insurgents , offer their dwellings to them for storing weapons or play the role of couriers during insurgency .
The security establishment , for instance , has found the raids on army camps by the ` ` fedayeen ' ' or the suicide squads belonging to the Pakistan based Harkat-Ul-Mujahideen or the Lashkar-e -Taiba , as completely unacceptable .
While the Government has decided to alter the balance of forces in its favour in the current round of the counter- insurgency campaign , its response to insurgency is being constrained by two key factors .
Besides , official circles are clear that the application of force should be such that Islamabad is prevented from making political capital out of ` ` human rights violations' ' in order to blunt the new counter- insurgency thrust .
