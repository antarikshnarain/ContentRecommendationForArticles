Ealham revives England's hopes

That subtle medium pace bowler Mark Ealham , tip toeing to the wicket like a cartoon cat ready to pounce on the Zimbabwe mouse , revived England 's hopes of a place in the final of the triangular tournament with a match-winning five lbws for 15 today .
Not that Dave Orchard gave any decision which did not pass scrutiny , but there are those umpires who , having got out of the wrong side of the bed , might have felt that once they had given two or three decisions in Ealham 's favour they had better turn down the rest .
Orchard , watching Ealham 's wicket-to-wicket deliveries with the admiration he might reserve for one of the local diamonds , raised his finger regularly and without hesitation as the Zimbabwe batsmen put up one of their feeblest displays .
When England lost the toss for the fourth time in a row we feared it might be outbatted and those concerns were almost realised when Ealham had Grant Flower lbw , third man out for 73 in the 21st over .
Using the unvarying method of getting in close to the wicket and bowling straight he had Andy Flower in the 25th over , Stuart Carlisle and Guy Whittal in three balls of the 27th and Murray Goodwin in the 29th .
He hinted that some had better learn quickly but as Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight eased them towards victory in bright sunshine - England is clearly more at ease in the daytime than under lights , a rare experience for it - his hope that the older men would lead the way also came true .
