Naidu denies threat to Vizag power project

The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister , Mr. N . Chandrababu Naidu , has said that there was no threat to the Vizag power project but asserted that the interests of the consumers would not be allowed to be compromised while finding a solution to remove the bottlenecks in setting up this thermal station .
` ` Negotiations are under way to thrash out differences related to power purchase agreement ( PPA ) and we have to wait for the outcome before knowing the fate of the project,' ' Mr. Naidu told PTI yesterday in an interview on the sidelines of the 30th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum here .
Pointing out that the 1,040 MW Vizag thermal project had been hanging fire for ` ` several reasons' ' , he did not give any time- frame as to how long it would take for the project to take off .
In reply to a question , the Chief Minister said issues relating to the escrow account for the Vizag project could be sorted out as and when the PPA was finalised between the State Government and the project promoters .
