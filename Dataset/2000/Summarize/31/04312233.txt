PMK welcomes TMC MLA's resignation

The Pattali Makkal Katchi has welcomed the Tamil Maanila Congress legislative party whip , Mr. R . Chokkar 's resignation from the MLA post protesting against the party 's decision to support the AIADMK in the Assembly by- elections .
The PMK founder , Dr. S . Ramadoss , said that other self-respecting TMC MLAs should also resign because Mr. Chokkar was forced to resign owing to the stand taken by the party .
The TMC president , Mr. G. K. Moopanar , had no courage to field candidates and he had pawned the self- respect of his party to Ms. J. Jayalalitha , the AIADMK supremo , said Dr. Ramadoss said .
The PMK had also planned to organise ` communal-religious harmony ' conferences in the southern districts with the aim to ensure brotherliness between dalits and other dominant communities in the southern part of the State .
