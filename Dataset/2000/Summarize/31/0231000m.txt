Bollywood gives officials a piece of its mind

Disquiet amongst the leading lights of Bollywood - Mumbai 's masala-laced Hindi filmdom - has resurfaced again after two years on the vulnerability of their trade to threats from the underworld and its consequences , as evidenced by the abortive bid on Mr. Rakesh Roshan 's life here recently .
If Mr. Bhujbal sought cooperation from the film personalities to enable the Government to nail underworld extortionists , the celluloid industry made it clear that it was feeling insecure since the attempt on Mr. Roshan 's wife was not an isolated one .
If Mr. Bhujbal promised every step to protect the film personalities - often high profile and easy targets , even soft ones - in return , he wanted them to fully cooperate and speak to the police , if necessary through their friends if not directly .
Mr. Roshan , it is learnt , had received some threats and demands from Chota Shakeel , an underworld don with a massive network in the city from his operators based in Karachi and even Dubai .
It is not known if he had made available this information before the attack , which he survived , but later , in an unconnected development , he underwent a cardiac surgery.From what sources at the meeting said , it is possible that the two sides , the protectors and the film-makers , gave vent to their feelings , sometimes quite accusatory of the other .
The meeting was attended by Mr. Roshan 's father-in-law , Mr. J. Om Prakash , himself a film producer of some renown , Mr. Pahlaj Nihlani , president of the Association of Motion Pictures & Television Producers , Mr. Ramesh Deo , Mr. Amit Khanna , Mr. Amrish Puri , Mr. B. R. Chopra , Mr. Shetty , Mr. Shakti Samantha , Mrs . Asha Parekh and a host of others .
