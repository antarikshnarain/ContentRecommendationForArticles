Pak. 'ready' to abide by Lahore Declaration

Without naming the Lahore Declaration , Pakistan has said that it is ` ` prepared to implement' ' the February 1999 Pakistan-India agreement pledging the two countries to the intensification of efforts for the resolution of outstanding issues , including Kashmir .
In a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , the Pakistani Foreign Minister , Mr. Abdul Sattar , however , claimed that India seemed ` ` intent on avoiding fulfilment of the ( Lahore ) agreement .
' ' The contents of the letter are in sharp contrast to the remarks made by Mr. Sattar at his first press conference on November 8 , 1999 , after taking over as Foreign Minister .
' ' Mr. Sattar , quoted by the official APP news agency as saying in his letter that Pakistan was also prepared to comply with the U.N .
If they prove sterile , as has been the experience between Pakistan and India , then the other civilised means evolved by the community of states should be availed of in the interest of peace,' ' the letter said .
` ` Crisis prevention is important in a region with nuclear capabilities but conflict resolution is the pre- requisite for establishment of durable peace,' ' Mr. Sattar argued .
