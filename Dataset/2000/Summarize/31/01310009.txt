BPP sore over NDA accord for Bihar

After weeks of wrangling , the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance today produced a half-baked agreement on seat-sharing in Bihar with one of its constituents - the Bihar People 's Party of Mr. Anand Mohan - refusing to sign it and even threatening to walk out of the alliance if his demand for eight more seats was not accepted .
Mr. Anand Mohan did not sign a joint statement issued on behalf of the NDA here this evening and nor was he present at the press conference where it was released by three grim-faced NDA leaders - Mr. Kailashpati Mishra ( BJP ) , Ms. Jaya Jaitley ( Samata Party and Mr. Sharad Yadav ( Janata Dal-U ) - all signatories to the statement .
The joint statement identified the 324 seats which the NDA constituents would contest though differences over 33 seats which would go the polls on February 12 remained unresolved .
Mr. Kailashpati Mishra , who did much of the talking , expressed satisfaction with the agreement and complimented Mr. L. K . Advani , Mr. Sharad Yadav and Mr. George Fernandes for making it possible to put up a joint front against Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav 's Rashtriya Janata Dal .
The NDA , he said , would oppose the RJD in each of the 324 seats with the BJP contesting 150 seats , the Samata 90 , the JD ( U ) 64 and the BPP 20 .
The party spokesperson , Mr. M. Venkaiah Naidu , said the party intended to contest 30 seats and an agreement on 27 seats with the Indian National Lok Dal had already been reached ; and the party had cleared the names of 24 candidates .
