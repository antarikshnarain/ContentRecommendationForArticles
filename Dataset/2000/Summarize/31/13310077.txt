Sculptural dialogue

Born in the city of Dusseldorff " which has a big tradition of fine arts " , he studied art as a natural choice , but changed over from painting to sculpture in the third year of the course as painting did not satisfy his urge for three-dimensional work .
" I arrived at the concept of dialogue and duality when I moved out of Germany along with eight other artists and went to Los Angeles to hold an exhibition " .
As the artist travelled , he became fascinated by the sculptures of medieval Europe and the ancient Asian sculptures of Borobudur and Angkor Vat .
Parallel to the internal exchange between my artistic vision and the influence of new places and people " , is the dialogue I desired to viewers to have with my sculptures .
" The concept of duality is most keenly perceived in the artist 's modern , abstract shapes , contrasting with the old-world , elegant colour of the sculptures .
Ernst Hesse , who has been a full-time sculptor for 22 years , will be displaying all his works at an exhibition at the Lalit Kala Akademi , Chennai from February 5 to 11 , 2000 , which is presented by the Max Mueller Bhavan .
