Kasparov assured of title

1 made accurate moves and forced team-mate Vladimir Kramnik to split points on Saturday to retain his title he won here last year .
His score of 8.5 from 12 games can be matched by both Kramnik and Peter Leko 7.5 , but the title here is shared if points are equal .
Suffering from flu , Viswanathan Anand took a quick draw against Jeroen Piket of the Netherlands in the 12th round indicating that he had lost interest in the Corus chess tournament 2000 after it became clear that he could not catch up with leader Kasparov .
Piket , playing white , faced the Slav defence from the Indian and the game was over in 17 moves while still in a well-known theoretical position.Kasparov achieved the result he hoped for today .
