Cong. opposes move to float bonds

1,000 crores for implementing power sector reforms by floating public bonds will amount to imposing a further burden on the deteriorating financial position of the State .
Mr. Rosaiah , who was referring to the statement by the Finance Minister , Mr. Y. Ramakrishnudu , about the State Government 's plans to seek the Centre 's permission to float bonds , told reporters here on Sunday that the Government had exceeded the ways and means position and availed itself of overdraft up to the maximum limit .
He alleged that investors ' confidence in the State Government was shaken following diversion of money raised through bonds to the treasury , including a sum of Rs .
300 crores each by the A. P. Roads Development Corporation , the A. P. Irrigation Development Corporation and the A. P. Irrigation Sources Development Corporation .
Describing this as a reflection on the State 's fiscal discipline , he wanted the Government to inform people about the ` ` pathetic state' ' of its finances before approaching them for more funds .
He reiterated the Congress demand that the TDP Government furnish a list of municipalities reserved for BCs , SCs , STs and women along with an explanation about the rationale for reserving the posts of municipal chairpersons .
