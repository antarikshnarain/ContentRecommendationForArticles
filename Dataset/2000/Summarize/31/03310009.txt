Pak. out of joint with times: Britain

The British Foreign Secretary , Mr. Robin Cook , severely castigated the military coup in Pakistan saying ` ` it is out of joint with the times .
' ' Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs here on Friday on ` ` foreign policy and national interest,' ' Mr. Cook said democracy has made major gains in the past decade .
Britain supported human rights and democracy for others because ` ` these are values we demand for ourselves,' ' Mr. Cook said .
Noting that Governments which respect freedom of expression are more likely to provide the transparency to be secure trading partners , Mr. Cook said , ` ` countries which observe the rule of law at home are more likely to accept their international obligations to fight drugs trade or halt weapons proliferation .
