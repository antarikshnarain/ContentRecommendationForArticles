'Gujarat notification on RSS will stay'

The Gujarat Home Minister , Mr. Haren V . Pandya , has ruled out the possibility of his Government withdrawing the controversial circular permitting employees to participate in the activities of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh .
Defending the circular , the Minister said the Government had neither made it mandatory for its staff to take part in the RSS activities nor invited them to join the organisation as the Congress ( I ) was making it out to be .
Several other outfits including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad , Hindu Mahasabha and Anand Marg along with the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and the Tameer-e-Millat remained on the Government 's list of banned organisations , he pointed out .
He said the Congress ( I ) Government in 1986 banned 32 outfits and included the RSS in the list though the Sangh was a social organisation engaged in character-building and promoting national spirit .
Mr. Pandya met his Andhra Pradesh counterpart , Mr. T. Devender Goud , and the Union Minister of State for Urban Development , Mr . B. Dattatreya , besides visiting the HI-TEC City and the National Police Academy .
