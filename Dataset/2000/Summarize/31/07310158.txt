Nationals from today

Karnataka and cue sport , have an intricate relationship and it is only fitting that the State Association in its golden jubilee year has been entrusted with the arduous task of hosting the 24-day-long billiards and snooker National championships for men , women and juniors , that begin with the women 's snooker and billiard from Monday .
Farah Khan , the reigning champion from the state in both snooker and billiards , is all hyped up .
Besides her final opponents of the last Nationals in Delhi - Amrita Mohapatra of Orissa in billiards and statemate Judit Walia in snooker - Farah will have to contend with Maharashtra 's Anuj Thakur , Usha Khandelwal and Varsha Mazumdar among others in snooker , and Renu Bharkutiya ( MP ) , Pooja Galundia ( Rajasthan ) and statemates Sridevi and Uma Devi in billiards , that follows snooker from February 4 .
But with the come-whatever-may attitude of the association big-wigs led by its mercurial president , S. Balasubramniam and secretary Subahu R. Desai leading from the front , most of the hardship has been swept under the carpet .
