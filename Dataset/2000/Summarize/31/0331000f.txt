Contentious Bangla 'safety' law passed

The Bangladesh Parliament today passed a new controversial law aimed at curbing terrorist activities and other crimes , even as the main Opposition alliance gave a call for a nationwide strike against it .
It includes provisions for special tribunals to deal with serious offences including arson and bombings , damaging of vehicles , public and private property , extortion , and hijacking .
The introduction of the bill came amid fervent Opposition criticism that the new legislation could well be used to repress political opponents by the government in power .
` ` The government is enacting the new law to cling to power and interfere in the Judiciary,' ' said Mr. Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan , Secretary General of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party .
