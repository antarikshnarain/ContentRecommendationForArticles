India for another Ministerial meet

India today proposed convening another ministerial meeting to ` ` consider' ' a new trade round and called for hammering out a ` ` consensus' ' at the official level on ways to further liberalise world markets .
The Union Finance Minister , Mr. Yashwant Sinha , during an informal gathering of ministers and chief executives at the ongoing meeting of the World Economic Forum , said ` ` much more work' ' should be done by the Ambassadors of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva to help evolve a consensus .
Consensus eluded several issues including environment and labour standards and agricultural subsidies during the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle last month causing a collapse of the planned launch of the new round of trade talks .
Sinha allays fears Earlier in an informal meeting with top business executives , Mr . Sinha allayed their fears over hurdles in setting up of power plants , asserting that a ` ` vigorous push' ' was being given to the power sector reforms in the country .
There appear to be ` ` distortions' ' abroad on the steps being taken to remove bottlenecks in getting foreign funds , he said about the ` ` impression' ' abroad that foreign companies needed ` ` hundreds of clearances' ' as in the case of the Enron power plant in Maharashtra .
An Enron representative said that the Dabhol plant , with Enron 's participation , was the first mega power project with a foreign partner after launching of economic reforms and therefore there were bound to be a few teething troubles .
