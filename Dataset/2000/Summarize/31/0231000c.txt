Sonia takes to the streets

The Congress ( I ) president , Ms. Sonia Gandhi 's breezy debut in street protest here this morning had the party on its toes with party managers sacrificing their Sunday - first to give her moral support as she courted arrest , and then to highlight what , for them , was clearly a big event .
Five thousand party activists , among whom were a number of marquee names , accompanied Ms. Gandhi from the AICC headquarters as she set out for the Prime Minister 's residence to give Mr. A .
Mr. Ajit Jogi , who was part of Ms . Gandhi 's ` ` court arrest' ' entourage , was barely out of the police station that the call of duty brought him to the AICC headquarters again - this time to prepare a brief for the Press .
Generally , four o'clock on a Sunday is siesta time at 24 , Akbar Road but this Sunday it was all perked up ; and Mr. Jogi , looking cheerful as ever but extremely apologetic , was ready with the news : details of Ms. Gandhi 's journey to the police station ; a list of ` ` prominent Congressmen' ' who had courted arrest with her ; an overview of her activity in Sabarmati where she had , by then , arrived to protest some more ( ` ` we are told that a large crowd has turned up to hear her' ' ) and the party 's plan to continue with the agitation until the controversial order is withdrawn .
And to clear any possible misunderstanding , he explained that the reason why the Deputy Speaker , Mr. P. M . Sayeed , and the Delhi Chief Minister , Ms. Shiela Dixit , did not join Ms. Gandhi was because the protocol prevented them .
