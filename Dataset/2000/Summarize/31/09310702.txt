Making magic with strings

Together , Larry Coryell and Dr. L. Subramaniam created magic at the Music Academy on the Republic day evening .
My father taught me my first lessons,' ' said Dr. L. At the end of the concert , the standing ovation seemed to never cease .
Larry has played alongside the very best guitarists around - McLaughlin , Eric Clapton , Jimi Hendrix , Paco de Lucia , Al Di Meola , and many more .
By the nineties , his place as a fusion pioneer and a seasoned musical traveller between the worlds of rock , Jazz , classical and Brazilian rhythms , was firmly cemented .
In the mid-nineties , he took part in a concert in Spain , spotlighting 32 of the world 's finest guitarists , including BB King , Keith Richards , Robie Robertson and Bob Dylan .
The last word : The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide ( 1985 ) notes that though Coryell is one of the most creative and accomplished modern electric guitarists , he has never been as popular as many less capable but better promoted musicians .
