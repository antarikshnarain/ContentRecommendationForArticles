UGC scheme: Joshi backs State Govt. stance

In what amounts to an endorsement of the Kerala Government 's attempt to implement the UGC scheme in toto and a rap in the knuckle for the college teachers boycotting classes on Saturdays , the Union Human Resource Minister , Dr . Murli Manohar Joshi , has said that college teachers could not hope to take salary and stay away from classes .
He refused to join the controversy over having classes in colleges on Saturdays , but said teachers should conform to the work schedule forming part of the UGC scheme .
Returning to the controversy over the Centre 's proposal to review the Constitution , he said there was no rationale for the controversy as the Constitution review committee was yet to be appointed .
Dr. B. R . Ambedkar himself had quoted Thomas Jefferson as having said that ` ` every new generation is a new nation and nobody is free to bind the new generation to their old views' ' , he added .
Referring to the President 's observation that it was the people who have failed the Constitution and not vice versa , Dr. Joshi said the system had to be so designed as to ensure that even if there was human failure it did not affect the system .
Asked whether it was the same Constitution which had facilitated the return to democracy , Dr. Joshi said it was not because of the Constitution that democracy was restored , but because of the will of the people , he added .
