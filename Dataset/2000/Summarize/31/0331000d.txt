Davos protests mirror Seattle scene 

About 500 demonstrators , apparently trying to mirror on a smaller scale the disturbances against the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle last November , were on Saturday kept away from the hall where the U.S. President , Mr . Bill Clinton , spoke at the World Economic Forum here , by phalanxes of heavily armed Swiss police officers .
But a group of demonstrators broke windows in a nearby McDonald 's restaurant that features a large statue of the company 's icon , Ronald McDonald , and , according to witnesses , injured several policemen even as Mr. Clinton issued an impassioned appeal to make global trade work for the poor , too .
In what amounted to his gospel on globalisation , Mr. Clinton told an audience of chief executives and national leaders that if the economic elite who had created , managed and benefited from globalisation did not listen to the concerns of those left out , protectionism would return .
` ` This is a new network,' ' Mr. Clinton said , speaking to an affluent and influential audience that included top business executives but also the leaders of South Africa and Colombia , and the Palestinian leader , Mr. Yasser Arafat .
` ` It was a balanced speech , but he left unclear whether he wants to impose our social norms on the developing countries,' ' said Mr. Horst Siebert , head of the Kiel Institute of the World Economy in Germany .
Without backing away from concerns that he insisted be covered by the world trade talks that eventually collapsed in Seattle in December , Mr. Clinton tried to address the unease in the developing world about his sincerity .
