25 girls 'kidnapped' in four months

Though only in a few cases complaints were lodged , police have found that more than two dozen girls were abducted during the last four months , a senior police officer told The Hindu .
In all the cases , the girls were kidnapped in the night when they were returning home after performing at the live band shows and were released by the abductors the next day .
One of the released girls revealed that after she was kidnapped , the abductors took her in a Maruti car to Shivajinagar and changed the number plate before going to an undisclosed place on the outskirts of the city , the sources said .
Meanwhile , police were also thinking of entrusting the Central Crime Branch sleuths with the job of inquiring into the lifestyles of the live band singers , a majority of whom were from West Bengal and Mumbai .
Police also expressed helplessness in initiating action against the live bands as their owners had not only obtained orders from the Supreme Court preventing police from interfering in their business but also filed contempt cases against police .
But on their part , a few Deputy Commissioners of Police and the Bangalore City Police Commissioner had chalked out a plan to curb the live bands without violating court orders .
