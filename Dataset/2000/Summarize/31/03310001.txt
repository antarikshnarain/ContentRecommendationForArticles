Gen , Mohammed Aziz , chief of the general staff , and Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Ahmed , director of Inter-Services Intelligence , or ISI .
Aziz speaks Punjabi , the language of Pakistan 's dominant Punjab province , and is a leader of the martial Sudhan clan , which controls the Poonch district of the Pakistani- controlled half of Kashmir,' ' Mr. Harrison said .
