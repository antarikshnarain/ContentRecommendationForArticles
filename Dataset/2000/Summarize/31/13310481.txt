Going beyond the tamasha

Even as you wonder how today 's youngster is invariably completely sure of himself , you also realise that neither college nor academics can make one a picture of such supreme self-confidence .
College is a grooming yard , no doubt but the cultural festivals that are open to all students offer excellent fora for hidden talents and skills to blossom .
Some of us who have seen girls and boys in schools walk past with a self-conscious smile and a gawky gait , have been surprised at the transformation in their mindset when they are for the first time exposed to the school and college mela that go by the common name , culturals .
At the school level , " Rhapsody " , " Razzmatazz " , " Reverberations " , " Renaissance " and " Genesis " spell fun , frolic and excitement for the students .
" But as it is , the standard is excellent , " says Shreeram Somani , a second year Physics student of D.G .
Rahul , a second year Computer Science student from the Hindustan Engineering College , is an avid quizzer , who never misses inter- college quizzes held as part of the culturals .
