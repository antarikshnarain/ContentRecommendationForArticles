They come with a tinkle

A dejected and disappointed Lakshmi decided to start a business where she could remind people of birthdays and wedding anniversaries of their near and dear ones and deliver gifts on their behalf .
Lakshmi , who was earlier involved in her family business ( her father and brothers run the famed L'Man School of Motoring ) , launched this personalised business in a small way , with co- operation from her family and friends .
The items offered by Thofah include dry/fresh flowers , cakes , Sixth Sense potpourri , Archie 's/Hallmark products , Tupperware products , terracotta artefacts , hard leather goods , Hanung soft toys , wrought iron candle stands , Nightingale stationery , Oriflame/Avon/Aviance beauty products and fresh fruit baskets , which are often decorated with dry flowers .
Lakshmi has a network in place for executing orders in the rest of the country and even abroad , though the gifts meant for people living abroad are normally restricted to flowers .
( The address is www.satyamonline.com/shopping/millenium/home.asp ) " But all this would never have been possible without the solid and silent support of my husband Vikram , " says Lakshmi with a glint in her eyes .
So next time you remember a friend 's birthday or an uncle 's wedding anniversary , but do not have the time to shop for them , just pick up the phone and call Lakshmi at 4903188 or mail her at thofah @ satyamonline.com .
