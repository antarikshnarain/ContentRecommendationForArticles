East Timor leaders for rights tribunal

The leaders of East Timor have welcomed the idea of setting up an international human rights tribunal for adjudicating the alleged atrocities by some Indonesian military personnel in that territory in the wake of its vote for independence from Jakarta 's rule last year .
The United Nations Secretary General , Mr. Kofi Annan , is expected to unveil in New York tomorrow his views on the recommendations of a panel which he had set up to investigate the circumstances in which the carnage occurred in East Timor .
It was in this context that the visiting East Timorese leader , Mr. Jose Ramos-Horta , said in Singapore today that any move to constitute a U.N.-sponsored tribunal would indeed ` ` help consolidate democracy in Indonesia'' .
Mr. Ramos-Horta and the chief independence leader of East Timor , Mr. Xanana Gusmao , arrived in Singapore today in the course of their tour of several Asian countries to seek help for their territory being run at present by a U.N .
Noting that an international tribunal ` ` is necessary' ' to put East Timor through its paces in every respect , Mr. Ramos- Horta took care to preface his comment with the observation that it was for the first time he had heard of such a possibility and that it needed to be confirmed .
