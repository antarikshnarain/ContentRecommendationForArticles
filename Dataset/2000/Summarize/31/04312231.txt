Boon for Govt. college students

Students in Government colleges in Tamil Nadu will be able to ride the information technology revolution wave and prepare themselves for the future under the ` ` computer education scheme' ' that the State has chalked out with private sector participation .
The Government wants to make about 75,000 Under-Graduate students computer literate and enable them to exploit the potential of the Internet in any field of study or employment that they may take up .
He had said that the school scheme would be extended to all the Government Higher Secondary Schools and gradually to Government Arts and Science Colleges .
Tamil Nadu has about 60 Government Arts and Science Colleges , with a strength of about 75,000 students .
These students , the government feels , are handicapped by lack of proper training at a time when ability to use computers is a pre- requisite for employment as well as further study .
The students pay a nominal sum to learn the Government syllabus and if required , they undergo additional computer courses outside school hours .
