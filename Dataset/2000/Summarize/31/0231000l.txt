I have forgiven Dara Singh, says Gladys

` My only desire is that Dara Singh does not kill any more and stops fighting against God ' , said Gladys Staines , the wife of slain Australian missionary Graham Staines .
` I have forgiven him ' , Gladys said of Dara Singh , who allegedly burnt alive her husband and two sons in Manoharpur in Orissa last year and added in a choked voice that ` forgiveness opens up the path of healing' .
Gladys , clad in a blue sari and accompanied by her daughter Esther , attended the book release function of ` Burnt alive : the Staines and the God they loved ' at Jaihind College in south Mumbai this evening .
