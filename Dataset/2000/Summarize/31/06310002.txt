Privatisation of Indian Airlines: a long way to go

The Cabinet decision to hive off 26 per cent of the Union Government 's stake in the national domestic carrier , Indian Airlines ( IA ) , is only the first step in a protracted exercise to disinvest 51 per cent from the airline .
Perhaps because of the initiative of the Minister of State for Disinvestment , Mr. Arun Jaitley , two major decisions have been announced - that the Centre will give away 51 per cent of its stake and then allow the ` strategic partner ' with a 26 per cent equity to run the airline.An inter-ministerial committee will now go into the details of the disinvestment mode and the Government will first pick a consultant or adviser to provide the framework and help identify a suitable , strategic partner .
IA 's fleet replacement and augmentation programme has been hanging fire for a couple of years , owing to political uncertainties at the Centre and the brief tenure of previous governments .
However , aviation sources argue there are enough safeguards to prevent any foreign airline from taking a majority stake in IA or capturing the country 's domestic aviation sector through the back door .
By offering them only 26 per cent , and keeping another 25 per cent with Indian financial institutions , airline employees and the public ( through the market ) , the Centre can be reasonably sure that no foreign investor will be able to secure a majority holding in the company .
If they want to attract the right kind of investors who can provide a competitive edge to IA , they must not only make the offer attractive , but outline a transparent framework for the future management of the airline .
