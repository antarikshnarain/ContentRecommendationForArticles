Current account deficit may be under control

Despite a slow down in the inflow of net invisibles in the current fiscal year , the current account deficit ( CAD ) is expected to be within acceptable limits of 1.5 to 2.0 per cent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
An analysis by ICRA has shown that net invisible earnings in the first half of 1999-2000 were placed at $ 4.1 billion , which was lower than the $ 5.1 billion inflow in the first half of last year .
The expansion in net invisible earnings over the last few years had helped in financing the expanded trade deficit till 1996-97 , thus keeping the current account deficit well within the perceived safety belt of around 1.5 per cent of the GDP .
But last year , a combination of weakening of oil prices , slumping non-oil imports and especially a recovery in exports in the fourth quarter had resulted in a curtailment of the balance of payments trade deficit for the second half by $ 3 billion , relative to the first half , the ICRA analysis has shown .
