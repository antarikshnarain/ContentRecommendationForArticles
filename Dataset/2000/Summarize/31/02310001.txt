'Pak. has planned another Kargil-type offensive'

A former close aide of a top Taliban commander , Maulvi Abdul Rasul Rab Sayyaf , who recently left Afghanistan for sanctuary in the West , said preparations and plotting of the proposed offensive were undertaken by Pakistan 's Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) commanders at the Harkat-ul-Mujahiddin-run Khawar Zilli camps in the Khost province of Afghanistan recently .
` ` The ISI has , or may be is , in the process of infiltrating regular Pakistani soldiers in mufti to lead and direct these operations and Pakistani military planners might raise the stake by arming mercenaries with light artillery guns and 84- and 120- mm mortars for the offensive,' ' the Taliban aide said on the condition of anonymity .
A self-styled commander-in-chief of a major Kashmiri militant group , the Hizbul Mujahiddin , Syed Salhuddin alias Mohammaed Yusuf , who is now housed in the Pakistan-occupied- Kashmir capital of Muzzaffarbad by the ISI , was recently quoted by Pakistani papers as threatening that mercenary groups on the Kargil pattern were ready to launch major attacks to cut off Indian border troops from their rear bases .
While the big mercenary groups have been told to occupy vital heights straddling the two highways , the Pakistani military planners are plotting to pin down border troops on the LoC by heavy engagement from across the LoC .
The Afghan aide said a large number of Harkat and Lashkar mercenaries , who infiltrated into Jammu and Kashmir during the Kargil conflict , had been directed to build huge mountain cave defences on the mountain heights overlooking the two highways to locate heavy mortars and light artillery guns .
He said the ISI had plotted siting of mountain-top cave camps in the heights over the Banihal , Ramsu and the adjoining Gool Gulabgarh areas for an eventuality of use in case of an all-out war with India , but were now sought to be brought into operation to focus international attention on Kashmir , post- Kargil and hijacking .
