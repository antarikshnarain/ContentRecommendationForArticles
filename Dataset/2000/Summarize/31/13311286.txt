Madras Miscellany

All the world 's a stage THE invitation I had received from the Booksellers ' & Publishers ' Association of South India was for a function honouring Prof. M . S. Swaminathan and for the release of the book , " Dance of Sarus , " a collection of essays by S. Theodore Baskaran .
* * * Handing over the baton BOYISH-LOOKING Shekhar Dattari , whose successful film on Silent Valley he is now following up by following the Monsoons for Discovery , eventually got his chance to make his contribution at the BAPASI function .
And that was the significance of titling the book " Dance of Sarus , " being as it was a reflection of Theodore Baskaran 's lifelong commitment to wildlife study and conservation .
Dayalan , son of Theodore 's elder brother , is a chip off the family block , not only displaying the same love for Nature but even to following Theodore 's sartorial style , their jibbas and churidars having the same distinctive cut .
But to me , a much more important book , in fact , a book I would rate as one of the most significant , if not the most , published in Madras in the last 25 years , is his " Message Bearers , " a perceptive study of how the political movements in Tamil Nadu used the stage and the screen in their evolution .
* * * Slowly , slowly to the stars IT WAS in one of my other guises I unexpectedly found myself at a 'kick-off ' function recently midst jargon such as TQM and TPM and QCs .
