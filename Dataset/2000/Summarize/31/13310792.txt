A dream come true

Swami Vivekananda 's vision , Swami Ramakrishnananda 's efforts and the prayers of the devotees of Sri Ramakrishna Math , Mylapore , have contributed to the transformation of dream into reality - the Universal Temple of Sri Ramakrishna .
A 7-feet tall white marble image of Sri Ramakrishna , like the one in the Belur Math temple , seated on a carved marble lotus , has been installed at the centre of the shrine .
With smaller sub-shrines for Sri Sarada Devi and Swami Vivekananda , and a magnificent main entrance built with ancient Dravidian architecture , the Universal Temple will be consecrated on February 7 .
