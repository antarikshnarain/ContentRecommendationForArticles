Reviewing the Constitution

IT WOULD be a pity if the debate on the Government 's move for a review of the Constitution degenerates into a controversy over ` ` differences' ' between the President , Mr. K. R. Narayanan , and the Prime Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee , pushing into the background the consideration of substantive issues .
The President-Prime Minister equation has been a favourite subject of discussion in the corridors of power and among political commentators , especially when there are signs of strains or even when the two take differing positions within the parameters laid down by the Constitution .
Two , Giani Zail Singh , in the Eighties , made Rajiv Gandhi jittery , so much so that the latter , fearing dismissal , did not allow Parliament to be prorogued , so as to be able to get a vote of confidence in the event of any drastic action by the President .
Last year , when Mr. Narayanan required Mr. Vajpayee , then head of the first BJP-led Government , to seek the confidence of the Lok Sabha , many in the sangh parivar and others saw it as a case of animus against the Prime Minister .
The NDA 's election manifesto contained a two-line reference to its plan to ` ` appoint a commission to review the Constitution not only in the light of experiences and developments since 1996 but , indeed , of the entire post-independence period , and to make suitable recommendations .
In both the cases , two ideas were specifically mentioned - to have a fixed ( five-year ) term for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies and to replace the present system of no-confidence motion with a ` ` constructive vote of no-confidence'' .
