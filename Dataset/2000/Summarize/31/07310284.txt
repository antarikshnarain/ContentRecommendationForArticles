A contest to determine the worst of teams!

In a case of too much too late , Central Zone and West Zone made key additions to their squads on the eve of their final Deodhar Trophy game , a match which will be contested for the most minor placings possible .
West and Central , who meet at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday , have only won a single match in three Deodhar Trophy games so far .
The progress of the two new faces in the two squads will be followed with interest : Central 's Sanjay Bangar produced a scene- stealing performance in the Wills Trophy and the Railwayman is being talked about as the kind of competitive all- rounder worth being tried out at a higher level .
Bangar sat out most of the Deodhar Trophy owing to a groin injury , but is likely to turn out for Monday 's match .
lThe teams : Central Zone ( from ) : Gyanendra Pandey ( captain ) , Sanjay Bangar , Gagan Khoda , Manoj Mudgal , Devendra Bundela , Harvinder Sodhi , Jyoti Yadav , Jai Prakash Yadav , Amay Khurasiya , Pritam Gandhe , P Krishnakumar , Murali Kartik , Anshu Jain , Ashish Winston Zaidi , Syed Abbas Ali and Raja Ali .
West Zone : Nayan Mongia ( captain ) , Ajit Bhoite , Zahir Khan , Wasim Jaffer , Amol Muzumdar , Jatin Paranjpe , Vinod Kambli , Nilesh Kulkarni , Abhijit Kale , Sitanshu Kotak , Amit Dani , Rajesh Garsondia , Hitesh Parsanna and Nilesh Modi .
