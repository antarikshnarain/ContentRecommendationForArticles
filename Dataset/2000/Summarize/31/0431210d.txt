Uncle holds child to Rs. 3-lakh ransom

A three- year-old boy has been allegedly kidnapped from Rajajinagar police limits in Bangalore , and the abductor , suspected to be the boy 's uncle , has threatened to kill the boy if his parents fail to pay him Rs .
Police said that Krishna , the youngest son of Mr. Kalyan , a marble slab fixing contractor , was found missing from their house in Prakashnagar 8th Main on January 24 at about 5.30 p.m . Rajajinagar police registered a ` ` missing' ' case the same day and were searching for the boy .
However , on Saturday afternoon , the abductor allegedly made a telephone call to Mr. Kalyan 's brother 's house , and the woman , who received the phone call was told by the caller that Krishna was in his custody .
The woman , who received the call , said the voice of the caller was similar to that of Pehalad , a relative of theirs , Mr. Kalyan told the police .
What is intriguing the police is that though Mr. Kalyan has a telephone at his residence , the ` ` abductor' ' had chosen to make a call to his brother 's house .
