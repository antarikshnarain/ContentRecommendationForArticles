A guest from Nigeria

INDIA AND THE West African nation of Nigeria have much to contribute to each other in terms of shared evolutionary experience and expertise in industry and agriculture and have so much in common that it is surprising the interaction between the two has been negligibly small compared to the scope .
By having that country 's democratically-elected President as the guest of honour during this year 's Republic Day celebrations , India has launched a major effort to set the relations right - and send the signal that it seeks to revitalise its links with a part of Africa that had remained neglected for long .
For a broader focus on the continent there could have been no better choice than Mr . Olusegun Obasanjo , Nigeria 's campaigner for good governance whose outspoken support for democracy was a feature of the last Commonwealth summit .
Mr. Obasanjo 's strong comments in Delhi against the menace of terrorism and his appeal to India that they jointly articulate their common concerns at international fora stem from Nigeria 's traumatic experience with violence and terrorism .
With a democratic government installed last summer after years of ruinous military rule and the consequent promise of internal stability , there is renewed opportunity for India to forge closer ties and explore new avenues of cooperation .
Nigeria is this country 's second largest trading partner on the continent after South Africa and can benefit by India 's experience as it pursues its own ambitious economic liberalisation programme .
