A change for the better

Now the Reserve Bank of India , has introduced a vending machine to speed up the issue of coins .
The dilemma for residents seems to be , you can not live with machines ( they take over particular jobs from people ) , you can not live without them ( people often do the job poorly or refuse to do it ) .
Plans are afoot to introduce the automatic vending machines in important places such as post offices , railway stations and a few nationalised banks , he adds .
50 one can get 15 two rupee coins and 20 one rupee coins and for Rs .
As the biggest change problem is encountered by commuters on MTC buses and at Railway ticketing counters , both these agencies could work out a schedule to get the change from the machine .
Senior officials feel that coins from Hyderabad and a few countries abroad will come to their locker soon , after which the shortage of coin supply will largely disappear .
