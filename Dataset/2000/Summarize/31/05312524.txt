Where textbooks preach hatred

A Pakistani educationist and scholar , Ms. Rubina Saigol , who examined the Pakistani textbooks , wrote a paper ` ` Learning to Hate : Fundamentalism , Modernity and Education' ' which was presented at a South Asia seminar in Berlin last year .
' ' Justifying the creation of Pakistan on the political plane , the class VIII Social Studies textbook absolves the Muslim League of any responsibility and says : ` ` Jinnah 's fourteen points ensured a political future for the Muslims .
' ' The textbooks prescribed for standards IX and X , under the title ` ` Pakistan Ideology' ' , go a step further : ` ` Pakistan ideology is based on the ideas of Islamic system and it was also a reaction to the Hindu and British exploitation of the Muslims of the subcontinent .
` ` The main reason for this difference of cultures , civilisation and outlook was the religion of Islam which can not be assimilated in any other system as it is based on the principle of... oneness of God... On the other hand , Hinduism is based on the concept of multiple Gods .
It does not differentiate on the basis of colour , creed or status... On the other hand , the Hindu society is based on caste system which downgrades the entire mankind... How could Muslims and Hindus become one nation in the presence of such glaring contrasts in their outlook and way of living ?
What is surprising is that the class V Social Studies textbook lays the entire blame for the Bangladeshi movement on the Hindus of the then East Pakistan : ` ` After the war of 1965 , India with the help of Hindus living in East Pakistan , incited the people of East Pakistan against West Pakistanis .
