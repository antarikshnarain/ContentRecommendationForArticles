U.P. seeks higher share in divisible pool of taxes

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister , Mr. Ram Prakash Gupta , has demanded that the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes should be raised from 29 per cent to 33 per cent , out of which 30 per cent should come from Central gross tax revenue and 3 per cent from additional excise duty .
Addressing a team of the 11th Finance Commission on a two-day visit to Uttar Pradesh , Mr. Gupta lamented that the alternative scheme of devolution recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission , which was to be implemented with effect from April 1996 , had not been implemented so far .
Favouring the population and backwardness criteria to determine the size of devolution , he proposed that 50 per cent should be distributed on the basis of population , 25 per cent and on the basis of I.A.T.P .
Uttar Pradesh was anticipating substantial revenue if this tax was levied and hoped that the 11th Finance Commission would recommend this .
Mr. Gupta drew the attention of the Commission to the severe fiscal crisis faced by the state and said this was due to increase in revenue expenditure without corresponding increase in revenue receipts .
