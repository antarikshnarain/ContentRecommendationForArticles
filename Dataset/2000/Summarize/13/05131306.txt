Coloured history

Sir , - Mr. K. N. Panikkar has crafted the article , ` ` Countering the revivalist spirit' ' TheHinduSunday Magazine , Jan. 2 ) , most dexterously and picked and chosen his facts impeccably .
Mr. Panikkar says the attacks on Christian organisations , the demolition of the Babri mosque and the communal riots are all the handiwork of the fanatic RSS , BJP , etc .
I have seen the articles by Mr. Panikkar and his friends which were directed towards the ` ` Hindus' ' in general and the so-called ` ` Hindu' ' organisations in particular whenever any communal incident took place .
However , I would request Mr. Panikkar to come to the areas bordering Bihar and Nepal , dominated demographically by Muslims , and see for himself what happens there : the dead of the ` ` Hindus' ' are not allowed to be cremated because of noisome fumes , the madrassas giving vent to unpatriotic feelings , the commission of mala fide acts in the name of minority institutions , the conversion of ` ` infidels' ' , etc .
I do request you all ( historians of a secular orientation ) to venture out of the metros and see what is happening in remote Thakurgunj and Madhubani in Bihar .
As for the vote bank , the Hindus are not guided by one religious head simply because the ` ` Hindu' ' consists of divisions through a large number of sects and sub-sects which have their own philosophies and are further sub-divided into castes and sub- castes .
