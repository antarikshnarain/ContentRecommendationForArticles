11 detained Israelis released

All the 11 Israeli nationals , detained at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport here last night due to ` ` some errors' ' in their travel documents and visas , were released tonight for their onward journey to Bangladesh , official sources at the airport said .
The immigration officials , who earlier contacted the Israeli embassy in Delhi to confirm the identities of the detained persons , said that they were mostly Hebrew-speaking and this caused a delay in the interrogation process .
This strengthened the suspicion about the Israelis who were about to board a Dhaka- bound Bangladesh Biman plane .
