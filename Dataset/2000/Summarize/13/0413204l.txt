A three-way battle emerging in Bihar

Even though the NDA has decided not to project any leader as the prospective Chief Ministerial candidate , political observers feel that the mantle would rest on either of these two leaders , unless somebody else emerges as the dark horse , if the alliance were to succeed in wresting power from the RJD .
In the RJD 's appraisal it would not be quite judicious to take on the principal opposition combine by projecting the incumbent Chief Minister , Mrs. Rabri Devi , as the next Chief Minister , even though Mr. Yadav would be in command of the party 's campaign .
The thinking is Mrs. Rabri Devi 's candidature is unlikely to carry the same weight with the electorate if the contenders for the Chief Minister 's post includes Mr. Paswan and Mr. Nitish Kumar .
The RJD leaders seem to reckon that it would not be easy to convince the voters of the party 's seriousness to rule the State if it were not to project Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav as next Chief Minister .
The RJD leaders do not rule out the possibility of Mr. Sharad Yadav favouring the former Union Minister , Mr. Devandra Prasad Yadav , in which case it would be essential to ensure that the Yadav community as a whole remain united and solidly behind the taller of the two Yadavs .
Although the BJP has been making some noise it may not find it easy to procure the top job for any of its aspirants as they do not match up to the stature of either Mr. Paswan or Mr. Nitish Kumar , nor enjoy the kind of following they command .
