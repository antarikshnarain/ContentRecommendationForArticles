Algerian Islamic group lays down arms

Perhaps more importantly , the Algerian Government 's success in persuading the AIS and its political arm the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) to give up militancy demonstrates that the President , Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika 's policy of ` ` peace and civic concord' ' is working .
Following the referendum , AIS members had surrendered in droves but the ambiguity about the full and partial amnesty had apparently caused some vacillation later on and the AIS had declared a freeze on the implementation of the earlier accord .
Yesterday 's announcement of a blanket pardon has apparently cleared the confusion about the partial and full amnesty and the AIS has consequently decided to dissolve itself .
' ' The dissolution of the AIS substantially means that the main Islamic political movement in Algeria , the FIS , has decided to give up the armed struggle which they launched in 1992 .
More moderate elements among the Islamists had stayed loyal to FIS and its armed wing , the AIS , while the hard-core broke off to form the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) .
Therefore , a person who belonged to a group affiliated to the broad umbrella of the AIS might not necessarily know the hide- outs , modus operandi of groups loyal to the GIA .
