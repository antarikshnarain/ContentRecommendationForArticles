Israel to withdraw further from West Bank

JERUSALEM , JAN. 12.The Israeli Government told Palestine yesterday that it would pull out of more of the West Bank and Gaza Strip by September , even if a final peace agreement is not reached by the deadline that month , officials said .
` ` Israel is committed to implementing the third-phase withdrawal whether there is a final status agreement or not,' ' the chief Palestinian negotiator , Mr. Saeb Erekat , told mediapersons after meeting his Israeli counterpart , Mr. Oded Eran yesterday .
The last handover , mandated by a September interim peace deal , was to have taken place on November 15 , but was delayed by a row between the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators over which areas should be included in the pullout .
With the completion of the January 20 handover , Palestinians will be in full or partial control of 40 per cent of the West Bank , which Israel captured from Jordan in its 1967 West Asia war .
