Press Council derecognises Editors' body

The council said in a press note that two members of the conference - Mr. Pramod Arya and Mr. Ashok Arya - who had become members of the PCI by providing false information had also been removed from the council .
The two ` ` nominated as members of the Press Council in March 1998 have ceased to be members' ' since it was established that the membership was secured by them through their organisation ( AISNEC ) ` ` by furnishing incorrect information and not disclosing correct facts .
