Even in dilemma there is hope

The International Film Festival of India opened here with a Cuban movie , and if memory serves right , it was the first time in a decade or more that the Latin American country was bestowed with this honour .
While the Festival Director , Mrs Malti Sahai , missed no opportunity in reminding her listeners that the Cuban entry , Life is to Whistle , had won several accolades at the Havana Festival , she kept one vital fact away from the media and others .
Life is to Whistle , may appear joyless as the first frames whiz past , but as the director tells this writer during an exclusive interview that ` ` more often than not life is to whistle away .
Perez , who worked with the Cuban auteur , Tomas Alea , considers him his teacher , and says that he was moved especially by Memories of Underdevelopment , which in the early 1960s gave political cinema a dramatic twist .
` ` It was also the first time that I saw a great movie-maker work with actors , with the camera...So involved was he with his creation,' ' Perez idolises his hero .
Although the Festival 's opening shot , Life is to Whistle has been deeply influenced by Alea , Perez says with disarming honesty that ` ` I have been moved by the work of many people .
