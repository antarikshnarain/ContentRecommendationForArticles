Joseph Swan (1828-1914): A determined experimenter 

Trained as a chemist , Swan 's scientific activities spanned a wide range : from incandescent electric lamp , electroplating methods and electrolytic cells to photographic processing .
In 1860 , Swan developed a primitive electric lamp that utilised a filament of carbonised paper in an evacuated glass bulb .
Through a newspaper advertisement , Swan came to know of the vacuum pump invented by the German chemist Hermann Sprengal and also Charles Stearn who was familiar with the technique of producing vacuum using Sprengel pump .
Swan and Stearn found that if , after producing the best possible vacuum , a strong current was passed to make the filament brightly , and if the bulb was further evacuated , a fairly durable incandescent lamp was the end product .
Thomas Edison ( 1847-1931 ) , the pioneer in electric lighting , developed an electric lamp on a principle similar to that of Swan and had already field a patent .
The commercial production of electric bulb in different sizes and in large numbers provided a great stimulus to the utilisation of electric power , first in public buildings , private residences and then in shops , factories , offices .
