Inputs from India critical: WTO chief

India 's ` ` extremely strong views' ' opposing linkage of trade to the social clause will be conveyed to the developed countries such as the U.S. and the European Union , according to the Director General of the World Trade Organisation Mr.Mike Moore .
In his first visit to a member-country after the Seattle conference , he held a series of talks with the Commerce Minister , Mr.Murasoli Maran on India 's stance on the proposed new round of trade negotiations as well as a host of other critical issues such as non-trade barriers and anti-dumping measures .
He also met the Union Finance Minister , Mr. Yashwant Sinha , in a three-day visit , marked by demonstrations held by both trade unions and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch .
In an interview , Mr Moore said the bureaucratic machinery was now moving prior to discussing the mandated agriculture and services negotiations this year .
' ' On India 's stand on social issues , he said there had been no change in its ` ` extremely strong views' ' since the Seattle meeting .
But I can tell you honestly there is no lessening of the Indian position as expressed in Seattle on the social clause .
