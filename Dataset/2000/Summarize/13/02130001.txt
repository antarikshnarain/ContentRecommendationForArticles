Sinha reconfirms decision to privatise banks

Presiding over a review meeting of public sector banks here , he categorically told the top bankers that they would have to look for alternative sources of finance to meet their re- capitalisation norms as prescribed by the Reserve Bank .
However , at the end of the meeting , the chief executives of the banks said that in the interest of competition , efficiency and coverage of services to all sections , it would be prudent to allow the public and private sector banks to compete and it was not necessary to fully privatise public sector banks .
In this context , the Minister said the bankers should deliberate on the creation of asset reconstruction companies and settlement advisory committees in banks so that the problem of NPAs was sorted out .
Mr. Sinha expressed concern at the declining credit deposit ratio and unsatisfactory customer service and urged the bankers to work out mechanisms to address these problems .
