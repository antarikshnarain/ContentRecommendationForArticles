Heavy snowfall in Kashmir brings relief

Even as normal life was affected in Kashmir Valley , the long awaited snowfall has come as a respite for the people who have been facing a dry spell for a long time .
Srinagar residents who had been praying for rain or snow for the last few months woke up to a heavy snowfall on Wednesday morning .
Children were the happiest lot as they ventured out to play snow games especially around world famous Dal Lake on Boulevard Road here .
In rural areas special prayers were organised for the snow as lack of snowfall last year had been proving disastrous for farmers .
