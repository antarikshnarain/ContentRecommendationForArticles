'Press campaign on to weaken CPI(M)'

A concerted campaign appears to be under way to malign as well as weaken the CPI ( M ) , Mr.Anil Biswas , secretary of the party 's West Bengal unit , said today .
For the second time within a month , Mr.Biswas who is also the CPI ( M ) politburo member , said a section of the newspapers had been conducting a ` ` systematic' ' campaign to ` ` disgrace' ' the party .
The immediate provocation for Mr. Biswas ' statement seems to be the report in a Bengali-language newspaper today on the strategy the CPI ( M ) rebels had worked out if the leadership takes a drastic step against them .
The report says the Transport Minister , Mr.Subhas Chakraborty , the former Rajya Sabha MP , Mr.Saifuddin Chowdhury , and secretary of the CPI ( M ) 's North 24-Parganas district , Mr.Samir Putatunda , are preparing to confront the leadership in the coming days .
The report is apparently causing a great deal of discomfort to the CPI ( M ) leadership as the party 's three-day politburo meeting is slated to be held in the city from January 14 .
