Protests mark new round of Janmabhoomi

The 11th round of Janmabhoomi , which concluded yesterday with impressive human chains in major towns in the State , was marked by contentious student protests , a bitter criticism of the Opposition role by the Chief Minister , Mr N.Chandrababu Naidu , and an embarrassing point for the Congress ( I ) , which would have abolished the programme had it come to power , but which was obliged to defend the participation of its MLAs in the programme .
The Janmabhoomi programme was introduced in 1997 , and has been hailed by independent observers as a programme of self help that has given a fillip to development of infrastructure in the villages , by eliminating red tape , and by empowering the villagers through the gram sabhas .
A road worth Rs 5 lakhs could be laid in three months because the gram sabha decided who could lay the road , and settle the bill , and the Congress ( I ) said that this was the surest way to benefit Telugu Desam Party workers , who could get the contract , inflate the cost of construction , and make neat profits .
The Junior Doctors strike , for higher stipends , had a greater impact on Janmabhoomi because it disrupted the free health checkup camps that were planned earlier , and it was the Junior Doctors who gheraoed the Minister for Finance , Mr Y.Ramakrishnudu , at the Visakhapatnam General Hospital .
The coming together of the Congress ( I ) , CPI , CPI ( M ) , CPI ( ML ) , and other smaller groups , to oppose not only Janmabhoomi but the other reforms under implementation , has posed a major challenge to the Chief Minister .
Mr. Chandrababu Naidu says that the Opposition wants the Government to fill up all backlog vacancies , increase stipends to junior doctors , provide increased DA , but levy no taxes , and still revive all sick public undertakings through infusion of capital and complete all on going irrigation projects .
