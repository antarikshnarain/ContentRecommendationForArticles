Fresh demand for Ongole bulls in Brazil

A team of parliamentarians , agricultural scientists and cattle breeders from Brazil is currently on a tour of Andhra Pradesh , the homeland of the rare breed , in pursuit of an exchange programme to improve their cattle wealth .
After enriching its cattle with the Indian breeds , Brazil too imposed the ban on imports from India on sanitary grounds as the Brazilian cattle was found to be more susceptible to foot and mouth and rinderpest diseases .
With the ban in both the countries , there was no way fresh blood could be ` ` officially' ' introduced into Brazil and it had set off clandestine semen movements from India to Latin America by Brazilian cattle importers .
But it is the Ongoles , that are bred in greatest numbers and most widely distributed in many countries , according to Mr. M. Narendranath , a cattle breeder and member of the monitoring committee of the Ongle Cattle Geram Plasm project of Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University ( ANGRAU ) here .
The irony of the story is that Brazil accounts for as many as 120 million Ongle breed cattle ( against its total cattle wealth of 180 million ) while the homeland of the breed has a meagre 35 lakh Ongoles of which the pure breed accounts for only five lakh animals .
A mutually beneficial programme could be worked out by forcing the Brazilian Government to come out with the plan to allow only import of semen processed at pre- designated bull studs in India , as is being done in the case of semen from Brazilian bulls to the U.S . Against this backdrop , the visit of the Brazilian team assumes significance .
