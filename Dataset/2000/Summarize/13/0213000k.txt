A sell-out to U.S., says Left

The Left Parties have said the Government has compromised with the national interest in signing an agreement with the United States to phase out quantitative restrictions ( QRs ) on imports by April 2001 .
While India 's other trading partners such as the European Union , Japan , Australia and Canada had agreed to remove the restrictions by 2003 , the U.S. succeeded in getting the Vajpayee Government to remove all restrictions on imports two years earlier , the CPI ( M ) pointed out .
While on the one hand , Central Ministers , notably the Commerce Minister , made noises about being custodians of the national interest , on the other , they quietly acquiesced in whatever was dictated by the WTO and the U.S . -
