Irked judge transfers Sharif case to junior

In a dramatic development , the judge hearing the hijacking case against the ousted Pakistani Prime Minister , Mr. Nawaz Sharif , announced today in open court in Karachi that he could not hear the matter and transferred it to be heard by a junior colleague .
After it was pointed out to Mr. Justice Shabbir Ahmed that intelligence agents were sitting in the court along with the accused , the presiding judge got angry and abruptly announced that he would no longer hear the case .
Before transferring the case , Mr. Justice Ahmed dismissed an application filed by Mr. Nawaz Sharif 's lawyers that the ATC had no jurisdiction to hear the hijacking matter .
