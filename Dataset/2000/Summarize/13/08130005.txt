High-yielding, disease-resistant hybrid maize

A HIGH-YIELDING , disease- resistant , full-season hybrid maize ( Zea mays ) has been developed by scientists at the Agricultural Research Station ( ARS ) , Arabhavi in northern Karnataka .
Christened DMH-2 ( Dharwad Maize Hybrid-2 ) , it is the first ever single cross hybrid developed at this centre and first in entire south India , according to scientists at the ARS , Arabhavi .
A derivative of a cross between CI-4 , a direct introduction from CIMMYT in Mexico , and KDMI- 10 developed from elite germplasm collected from the national pool , the new hybrid closely resembles DMH-1 .
It has recorded a grain yield of 5400-5600 kg per hectare , and a dry fodder yield of 7000-7500 kg per hectare .
The nutrient dose prescribed for raising it to good yields is 150 kg nitrogen , 75 kg phosphorus and 37.5 kg potash per hectare .
This was recommended for release by the Plant Scientists Group of UAS , Dharwad , which met in August 1998 at Raichur , and ZREAC and ZREFC meeting of Zone III held in April , 1999 at RRS , Bijapur .
