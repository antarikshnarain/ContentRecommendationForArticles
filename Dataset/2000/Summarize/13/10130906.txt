Man's activities linked to religion

Even among several creations , only some are privileged to be born as human beings , based on the theory of action and reaction ( Karma ) .
Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Swami , in a discourse , explained how every man and woman can remain devoted to God , obtain His grace , and pray for his or her release from worldly bondage .
While it is mentioned that bathing in river Ganga can redeem a devotee from sins , this step is only for one who holds to God with firm belief .
On the other hand , can fish or animals which remain in the river for ever , be said to get rid of their sins ?
That is why repeated emphasis is laid on getting associated with preceptors and pious persons , which will enable one in getting the impurities being flushed out of the mind .
Devotees should observe the Rules of Moral Law , practise austerities , cultivate good thoughts , words and deeds .
