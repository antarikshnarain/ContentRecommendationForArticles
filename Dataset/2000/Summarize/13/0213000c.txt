No change in funds allocation formula for poverty alleviation

Pant , the Union Minister for Rural Development , Mr. Sunderlal Patwa , the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister , Mr. M. Karunanidhi , the Rajasthan Chief Minister , Mr. Ashok Ghelot , the Orissa Chief Minister , Mr. Hemandra Biswal , and the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister , Mr. Ram Prakash Gupta ( he was represented by the State Planning Minister , Mr. Suresh Kumar Khanna ) , felt that even as some States were unhappy with the methodology for estimating the incidence of poverty , it would be prudent to continue with the existing formula since funds had been allocated on this basis for the first three years of the Ninth Plan period .
However , the States present at today 's meeting felt that the Planning Commission should also incorporate the views of the States while finalising allocations for poverty alleviation programmes during the Tenth Plan .
Till then , estimates were made on the basis of the data on household consumption expenditure released by the National Sample Survey Organisation ( NSSO ) and the recommendations of the methodology of estimation made by a ` ` task force' ' on projections of minimum needs and effective consumption demand .
But a comparison with the earlier estimates and those of the ` ` expert group' ' revealed that as many as eight States were adversely affected in their share of allocations under the poverty alleviation programmes .
However , this adjusted formula was also not acceptable to some States who felt that the adjustment worked out was arbitrary and hence should not be used for allocation of funds under rural poverty alleviation programmes in the Ninth Plan .
Some States advocated maintenance of status quo in the allocation of funds as per the earlier formula while some others wanted the ` ` expert group' ' formula to be implemented .
