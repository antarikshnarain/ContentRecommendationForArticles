Raman, Mouma triumph

Chetan Baboor 's quest for a record fifth consecutive men 's title was squashed by S. Raman while Mouma Das proved third time lucky in clinching her maiden women 's title in the Sahara 61st Senior National and Inter-State table tennis championships at the Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar Stadium here on Wednesday .
