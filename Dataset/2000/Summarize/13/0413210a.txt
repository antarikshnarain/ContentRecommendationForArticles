DIC to get ISO 9002 tag

In an exclusive interview with TheHindu , Mr. V.P.Baligar , Commissioner for Industrial Development and Director , Industries and Commerce , said the ISO had just completed the pre-assessment audit in this regard .
The department had to meet criteria like a timeframe for operations , training and motivation programmes for the staff , a system for evaluation , a performance target and a staff manual , Mr. Baligar said .
During the past one year , he had streamlined the process of ` clearances ' for industries with important certificates issued within a few days and in the case of SSIs , subsidies sanctioned within one month .
In letters sent to industrialists , Mr. Baligar stressed that he would be personally responsible for any delays and appealed to them not to resort to bribing to get their work done ; neither need they hesitate to complain if there were irregularities .
The departmental staff were made to understand that delays in clearances could mean huge losses each day for a small-scale unit which was paying heavy interest on its borrowings from banks .
These helped in assessing the most common complaints of industries which ranged from power supply to problems with the Pollution Control Board and delays in getting the subsidies for SSIs .
