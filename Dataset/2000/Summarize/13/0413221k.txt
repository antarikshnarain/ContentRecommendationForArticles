Rajasthan CPI(M) criticises Election dept. decision

The Rajasthan State unit of the CPI ( M ) has objected to the State Election Department 's decision to bar persons against whom criminal cases are pending from contesting the coming panchayat elections .
The meeting , by Mr. Sheopath Singh Makkasar , former MP , presiding said these decisions could amount to violation of citizen 's right to fight elections .
In the case of workers of political parties there could be politically motivated cases against them and denying the right to contest elections on this ground could only ` ` encourage' ' attempts to falsely implicate persons , it felt .
