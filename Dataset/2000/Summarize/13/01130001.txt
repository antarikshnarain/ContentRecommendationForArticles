Cabinet nod for fresh probe into anti-Sikh riots

A fresh judicial probe into the November 1984 anti-Sikh riots by a retired Supreme Court judge is among the several decisions taken by the Union Cabinet which met here today .
The other important proposals cleared by the Cabinet include another relief package for the super cyclone victims of Orissa , on technology mission for improving the quantity and quality of cotton produced in the country , extending satellite networking facilities to Indian companies and sharing of the INSAT time with non-Government users and leasing out five major airports in preference to their corporatisation and an Ordinance to amend the Debt Recovery Tribunal Act .
The Cabinet rejected the controversial recommendations by the Bakshi Committee , proposing higher salary benefits for the faculties of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Post-Graduate Institute , Chandigarh .
The one-man Judicial Commission to be set up to inquire into the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi and other areas of the country in the wake of the assassination of the former Prime Minister , Indira Gandhi , on October 31 , 1984 will be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India .
Apart from examining the complaints and allegations either by individuals or the Government , the Commission will find out whether the heinous crimes could have been averted and whether there were any lapses or dereliction of duty on the part of police and others .
Denying that the decision was politically motivated and directed against the Congress ( I ) , the Union Parliamentary Minister , Mr . Pramod Mahajan , who briefed the media after the Cabinet meeting , reeled off facts and figures to justify the decision .
