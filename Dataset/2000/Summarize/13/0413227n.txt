'Uniform ST will help industrial growth in Pondy'

The general secretary of newly formed Pudhuvai Maanila Vanniyar Munnetra Kazhagam , Mr. G. Tiruvarasan , said here today that his organisation was a non-political one and it would champion the cause of the backward and most backward classes in the Union Territory .
Welcoming the adoption of uniform sales tax in all States , Mr . Tiruvarasan told a press conference here that implementation of the uniform sales tax would encourage the industrial growth in Pondicherry .
He said those setting up new industries in the Union Territory were simply grabbing the farm lands and changing their nomenclatures often just to utilise the tax concessions and also get exemption from other levies .
The main reason that prompted him and other office bearers to float the kazhagam for the welfare of the backward classes was that all along nothing had been done for the wellbeing of the Backward classes in Pondicherry under the leadership of Dr. S. Ramadoss , founder of the PMK , he said .
When the PMK was launched by Dr Ramadoss , Mr. Tiruvarasan said he had put in his hard work and despite defeats in three elections to the territorial Assembly he had remained with the party and followed its principles .
