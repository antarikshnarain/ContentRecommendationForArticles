Naxalite killing: HC orders re-post-mortem

The Madras High Court today directed the Dharmapuri district Collector and Revenue Divisional Officer ( RDO ) to conduct a re-post mortem on the body of Ravindran , who was allegedly shot dead ` ` in an encounter with police' ' near Dharmapuri two days ago .
Passing orders on a petition filed by Ravindran 's wife , Ms . Nirmala , a Law lecturer in Vizag University , Mr. Justice P. D . Dinakaran said the re-post mortem should be conducted in Government General Hospital , Chennai , in the presence of the Director of Forensic Sciences Laboratory , Chennai , at the earliest possible time .
Ms. Nirmala 's petition contended that Ravindran had resigned his post as Engineer in the Telecom department , to work for the cause of farm labourers of Dharmapuri .
She submitted that Ravindran was taken into custody on January 7 , and was beaten up and tortured to extract confession to implicate him in several criminal cases .
It was necessary to conduct the post mortem in the presence of lawyers and doctors of her choice , who could lend assurance to her that the inquest was done fairly , Ms. Nirmala said .
On January 10 , the Dharmapuri police stated that Ravindran , as a member of the banned People 's War Group , was involved in the burning of a bus near Hoggenakal earlier this month .
