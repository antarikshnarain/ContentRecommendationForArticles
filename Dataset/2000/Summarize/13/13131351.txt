A hallowed house of history

However , today , true to its name , the building , presenting a new look , houses a gallery of 150 laminated and rare photographs of Swami Vivekananda , depicting the highlights of his eventful but , brief life .
Starting with his early days as a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa , the gallery contains photographs taken during his visit to the U.S. and the U.K .
There are some pictures such as the one featuring Swami Vivekananda with his colleagues immediately before the cremation of Ramakrishna ( in August 1886 ) , and another on the reception given to him at Calcutta in February 1897 after his return from the West.In addition to the famous photograph of the Swami in a meditative pose , the gallery has a picture of the Swami 's palm impression besides some other photographs carrying his autograph .
Thanks to the efforts of the Chennai chapter of the Ramakrishna Math , the structure , which was in a state of decay till recently , has been given a new lease of life while retaining all its original characteristics .
