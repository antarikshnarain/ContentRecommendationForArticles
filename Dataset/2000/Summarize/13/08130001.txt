Embryos and evolution 

After the concept of recapitulation had fallen from grace , the British marine biologist Walter Garstang suggested in the 1920s that the opposite process to recapitulation , what he called paedomorphosis ( literally ` ` child shape' ' ) might be a powerful process in evolution .
Although it was originally thought that we simply preserved our ancient childhood looks into modern adulthood , the actual process has involved a speeding up of brain and skull growth , but a slowing of jaw growth .
Some anatomists suggest that other adult human anatomical features are reminiscent of juvenile apes : a general lack of body hair , thinner skull bones , smaller teeth , and relatively shorter arms and otes .
There has been more than a doubling of body weight and height since the australopithecines of about 4.5 million years ago , brain volume has more than trebled and its complexity increased , and our hind limbs have lengthened relative to the trunk .
Analysis of fossil hominid teeth indicates that growth phases have been stretched out during evolution , allowing hominids to grow longer legs to carry their large body upright , larger foot bones to support a greater weight , and a larger brain .
In fact , it is often remarked that the Neanderthals , a type of archaic human that survived until about 50000 years ago in Europe , possessed a slightly larger brain ( at about 1440 cubic centimenres ) than modern humans ( about 1400 cubic centimetres ) , but an inferior stone-tool technology .
