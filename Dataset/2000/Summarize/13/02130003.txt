'Identities of hijackers can be established'

Dr. Anita Joshi , a hostage of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight whose medical skills were a boon to the passengers , today confirmed that all hijackers invariably kept their masks on but some alert hostages got a few glimpses of parts of their faces when the ` ` tormentors' ' were either eating or drinking .
These glimpses by different passengers together could give enough clues to build a picture of the hijackers and could be matched with the photographs released by the Union Home Minister , Mr. L.K .
She told The Hindu today that she was surprised that a section of Indian language press as well as the Washington Post ( carrying an AP report ) had made out that she had seen and recognised the faces .
Another passenger , hailing from a town near Mumbai who requested anonymity , told The Hindu he recognised the persons in the pictures released by the Home Minister saying he had seen them in the departure lounge of Kathmandu International Airport and also onboard the aircraft before they put on masks .
Their fears are augmented by the findings of the Mumbai police that two Pakistani nationals , one Indian and one Nepali - both ISI agents - had made Mumbai their base to provide all back-up , logistics and communication services to the hijackers .
She said that officers of an Indian intelligence agency had interviewed her and two other women passengers , including Mrs . R.I. Tolia whose husband is a senior IAS officer .
