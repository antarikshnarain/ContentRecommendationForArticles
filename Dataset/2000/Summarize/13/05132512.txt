Europe's corruption scandals

A recent series of embarrassing disclosures of corruption in high places in Western Europe , touching many of the leading lights , has shaken the well- entrenched establishments in these countries .
Europe 's superstar has admitted taking illicit cash donations and operating a system of secret slush funds during his long years at the helm and faces a criminal investigation that can result in imprisonment for five years and a hefty fine .
Mr. Kohl initially denied any wrongdoing , stating only that the funds he received did not benefit him personally and had gone into the coffers of his ruling party , the Christian Democratic Union .
The Kohl enquiry has provoked a widespread debate in Western Europe over the extent of such political corruption that cuts at the very root of democracy .
After last summer 's campaign funding allegations against the U.S . President and the trial of ex-Ministers and connected resignations in Brussels came the scandal in France in November that saw the exit of the Finance Minister , Mr. Dominique Strauss- Kahn .
In almost all instances , including that involving the German statesman , the funds have gone primarily to the party rather than to individuals , possibly indicating where the system has rotted .
