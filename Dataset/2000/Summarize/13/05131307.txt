A weighty consideration

During my recent visits to India , usually disembarking at the Anna international airport , Chennai , I myself have seen security lapses at the departure gate .
In November last , during my departure from Chennai for Colombo by an IA flight , the security personnel who manned the x-ray machine demanded money , saying my handbag was a little heavy .
I also brought to their notice the fact that I had shown the bag to the ticketing officer and that he allowed it and issued me a tag for it .
If the x-ray machine flashes , an officer is supposed to open and examine a bag but he is more interested in checking its weight .
A Britisher and a Swedish national , who were seated next to me and were watching these officers , said : ` ` Oh God , I do n't want to go on this !
