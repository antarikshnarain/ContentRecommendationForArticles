Free run for sugar cooperatives in Maharashtra

When the sugar barons of Maharashtra gathered for their annual fest here , there were smiles on almost all faces , indicative of the good times ahead because ` ` their Government , controlled by them and for them' ' is back in business .
Mr. Deshmukh said that the sugar barons managed ` ` power houses' ' and ` ` power centres' ' in the countryside .
The NCP leader , Mr. Sharad Pawar followed him in and was received well by the audience indicative of how , despite divisions , the lobby 's tilt was in favour of the NCP leader .
' ' Mr. Ram Meghe , newly elected chief of the lobby today told Mr . Deshmukh , ` ` Now that the Congress Government was back , critical proposals for the sugar cooperative sector would be passed more easily .
Mr. Pawar , who is considered the power behind the Congress ( I ) - NCP Government here , had been attending most of the annual general meetings of the sugar federation , either as Chief Minister as in 1978 , or later as a key political figure , Union Minister or later again as Chief Minister .
