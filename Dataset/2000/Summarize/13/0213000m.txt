AP, Karnataka squabble over Krishna water

The utilisation of 330 tmc ft. of the Krishna water under Scheme B of the Bachawat Tribunal Award has become a fresh bone of contention between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh .
Earlier , objecting to the move by Karnataka to raise the height of the Alamatti Dam to Full Reservoir Level of ( FRL ) 524.256 metres , Andhra Pradesh had dragged the State to the Supreme Court .
The share upto 2,060 tmc ft was 550 for Maharashtra , 700 tmc ft. for Karnataka and 800 tmc ft. for Andhra Pradesh .
In excess of 2,060 tmc ft , the share of Maharashtra was 35 per cent ( 24.5 tmc ft. ) , Karnataka 50 per cent ( 35 tmc ft. ) and Andhra Pradesh 15 per cent ( 15 tmc ft. ) .
Karnataka in fact had planned the construction of the Alamatti dam at a height of FRL 524.256 metres under the UKP way back in 1968 for the creation of both irrigation facilities and hydro- electric power generation .
Karnataka is likely to face a severe law and order problem if two political leaders of Gulbarga District , Mr. Vaijanath Patil , and Mr. Hanumantha Rao Desai decide to carry out their threat that about 50,000 farmers would perform ` ` kar seva' ' for increasing the height of the Alamatti Dam to FRL in February as part of a planned agitation .
