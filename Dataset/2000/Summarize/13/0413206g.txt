Special drive against cow slaughter in Gujarat

Announcing this , the Minister of State for Home , Mr. Haren Pandya , said the anti-cow slaughter drive , particularly to unearth illegal slaughter houses flourishing in the State , was part of police action plan drawn a few months ago to check the crime rate in the State .
At the concluding ceremony of the camp on Sunday , the RSS chief , Mr.Rajendrasinghji ( Rajju Bhaiya ) , had even indirectly blamed the inaction of the Central and the State Governments to protect the cow progenies from the thriving , illegal slaughter houses .
Mr. Pandya said the Government was also thinking of invoking the provisions of the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act ( PASA ) to check cow slaughter and make amendments in the Cow Protection Act to make it more stringent and deterrent .
The Additional Chief Secretary ( Home ) , Dr. V. V . Rama Subba Rao , said the Government was studying whether the non- cognisable offences relating to animal slaughter could be converted into a cognisable offence , particularly in relation to cow slaughter .
