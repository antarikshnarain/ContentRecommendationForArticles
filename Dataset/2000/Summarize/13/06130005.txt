Telco to enter luxury segment

Putting its modest performance in selling the Indica behind , Telco today announced plans to manufacture a luxury car - Magna - and unveiled a two seater concept sports car ` Aria ' based on the Indica platform .
` ` There will be robust growth in the next two years with 60 to 65 per cent growth due to take place in the low end,' ' said the Telco chief , Mr. Ratan Tata , while justifying the move to produce a car which could be priced above the top of the line luxury cars in India such as the Lancer and Honda .
The Tata Aria , unveiled by a Bollywood filmstar , is a two-seater roadster concept and has been developed by Tata Engineering along with Italy 's Idea Institute .
The Tata pavilion at the Auto Expo also features several versions of existing models including the Tata Indica 2000 which is a petrol powered 75 bhp engine , a face-lifted version of Tata Sumo Premia with a new front and a tighter body design and the Euro II diesel Indica .
