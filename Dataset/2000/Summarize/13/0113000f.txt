Tibetans waiting for India's move

With the issue of granting political asylum to the 17th Karmapa threatening to snowball into a major controversy , the Tibetan government-in-exile is now mounting pressure on the Indian Government to recognise the presence of the 17th Karampa and grant him asylum .
Ms. Taft , who is here to overlook the scheme initiated for Tibetan refugees , reportedly held consultations with senior Tibetan officials last evening over dinner .
State officials here are intrigued why he is not being put up in the spiritual leader Dalai Lama 's palace in McLoedganj which enjoys the highest protection as the 14-year-old Karmapa faces a security threat .
In normal circumstances , any Tibetan migrant coming to Himachal Pradesh without valid documents is treated as ` ` illegal person' ' and is deported back to Nepal after registration of a police case against him .
The Tibetan officials feel that international opinion in the coming days would force the Indian Government to take a decision on the issue notwithstanding the threat from China which has asked India not to grant political asylum to the Karmapa .
Meanwhile , it is learnt that preparations are already being made at the Shera Billing of Monastery of Tai Sutu Rampoche in Beed near Baijnath about 45 km from here for the formal arrival of the 17th Karmapa .
