More funds to modernise State police

In a bid to improve the infrastructure of the State Police forces , the Centre has increased the allocation under the Union Home Ministry 's scheme for modernisation of police forces from Rs .
During 90s , the amount under the scheme for modernisation of police forces were substantially raised to Rs .
It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments to train , equip and modernise their police forces to keep pace with the changing security and law and order scenario since it is a State subject .
However , in order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments , the Home Ministry has been implementing a scheme for modernisation of State police forces under the non- Plan since 1969-70 .
