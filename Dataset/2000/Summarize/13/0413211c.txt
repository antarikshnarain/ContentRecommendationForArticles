The Kerala Cabinet has appointed the former judge of the Kerala High Court , Mr. K. K. Narendran , as a one-man Commission to suggest fresh criteria for identifying ` creamy layer ' among backward communities in the State .
The Narendran Commission on ` creamy layer ' , appointed to provide ` maximum benefits permissible within the parameters of the December 13 Supreme Court verdict to backward communities ' , would have to submit its recommendations within a month .
The Commission has been asked to suggest fresh criteria for determining the ` creamy layer ' among backward communities in tune with the Supreme Court directives and advise the Government whether any community could be excluded from the ` creamy layer ' on the basis of their traditional vocations or some other criteria .
It has been told to see if any separate criteria was necessary to assess the income and assets of different sections figuring in the ` creamy layer ' and if so , what should be the ceiling on income and assets and also whether any particular income should be excluded from calculations .
Briefing reporters after the Cabinet meeting here today , the Chief Minister said the three-member panel for assessing the caste-wise composition of employees in State Government service and public sector units would be given six months ' time to submit its report .
The Finance Minister , Mr. T. Sivadasa Menon , said the Cabinet had also decided to move a resolution in the next session of the State Assembly seeking a Constitution amendment to extend reservation benefits to the disadvantaged among the forward communities and to ensure that the ` creamy layer ' norm did not result in jobs reserved for backward communities falling into the general pool .
