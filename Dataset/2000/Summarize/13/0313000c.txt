U.S. to seek censure of China

The State Department spokesman , Mr. James Rubin , told mediapersons at his daily press briefing on Tuesday that the U.S . would back the resolution in March because of China 's poor human rights practices , referring to restrictions on freedom of speech , dissent and religion .
` ` Over the past year , the Government of China intensified its crackdown on political dissent , initiated a campaign to suppress the Falun Gong , and intensified controls on unregistered Churches and on political and religious expression of ethnic minority groups , especially Tibetans .
Noting in particular the issue of Tibet and the high- ranking , 14-year-old Karmapa Lama who trekked to India last week , Mr . Rubin said restrictions on freedom of speech , dissent and religion had motivated the U.S. decision .
' ' Responding to another question whether the U.S. would rescind its decision to introduce the resolution if China were to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights , he replied that the convention was just one factor and ` ` unless there are concrete steps to improve human rights situation,' ' the U.S. would go ahead with its decision .
