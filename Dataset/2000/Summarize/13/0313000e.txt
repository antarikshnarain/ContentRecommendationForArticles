U.S. senators to visit Pak.

While a four-member U.S. Senate delegation led by Mr. Tom Daschle arrived tomorrow for a three-day visit , Senator Sam Brownback , whose responsibilities directly concern South Asia , arrives on Saturday .
In another development , the Foreign Minister , Mr. Abdul Sattar , has denied questioning the ` ` integrity and patriotism' ' of Qazi Hussain Ahmed , Jamaat-i-Islami chief , as part of the military government 's pro-CTBT campaign .
This clarification came after Mr. Sattar was quoted as saying in The News today about the Qazi that the ` ` nation can not allow those to issue certificate of treason ( sic ) who had opposed creation of Pakistan'' .
` ` Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar protested about the charge of ` treason ' against those who support the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty....nor did he make any comment in any conversation on the stance of Jamaat-i-Islami prior to 1947,' ' a Foreign Ministry statement said .
` ` The Government is determined to maintain and develop Pakistan 's nuclear capability in order to ensure a credible and reliable deterrence against manifest threats to is security....when and if the CTBT comes into force , every State will be bound to refrain from conducting any nuclear test explosions .
