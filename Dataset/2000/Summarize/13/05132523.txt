Poverty as a global challenge

The revolution continues , and the Internet is rapidly becoming the symbol of a new kind of civilisation that is developing on the planet , cutting across traditional barriers of nationality and religion , gender and generation , and knitting people together in ways and with long range implications that we are still only dimly beginning to understand .
Tens of millions of human beings have perished in major and minor wars , concentration camps and gas chambers , slave archipelagos and racial oppression ; and the atomic blasts in Hiroshima and Nagasaki have become a symbol of the unimaginable destructive power unleashed by this very science and technology .
The stockpiles of nuclear weapons , enough to destroy not only all human beings but all life on the planet many times over , the wanton destruction of the biosphere and pollution of the environment ; the vast areas of poverty and deprivation that exist around the world , specially in Asia , Africa and Latin America ; the malign network of drugs , arms smuggling and trafficking in human beings ; the steady stream of horror and violence in the movies and on television which is distorting the consciousness of the entire human race - all these malign manifestations have also developed in this century .
In the ancient Hindu texts there is a concept of the human race as a single , extended family - Vasudhaiva kutumbakam - and yet we have a situation where farmers are paid not to grow grain , and milk is poured down drains at a time when millions of human beings are on the verge of starvation .
Let us never forget that each human being on this planet , regardless of race or creed , religion or nationality , represents a unique nexus of physical , psychological and spiritual dimensions ; and that in the final analysis the developed world will jeopardise its own security if it continues to ignore the less developed areas of the planet .
It is only if we are able to open our hearts and minds fully to that light that it will be possible for us to move beyond the cruel contradictions of the century past into a new dimension of sanity and harmony , as our planet hurtles headlong into the future astride the irreversible arrow of time .
