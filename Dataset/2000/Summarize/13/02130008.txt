The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister , Mr. M . Karunanidhi , today called on the Prime Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee , and discussed with him number of issues concerning the State .
According to a close aide of the Chief Minister , Mr. Karunanidhi had originally intended his meeting with the Prime Minister as a courtesy call as Mr. Vajpayee has recently undergone a cataract operation but the meeting went on for 45 minutes .
In the course of his meeting Mr. Karunanidhi , who was here to attend the sub-committee meeting of the National Development Council , reiterated the view of the Tamil Nadu Government that there should not be any deadline to the State for adherence to the uniform sales tax floor rates and the matter should be left to the states .
