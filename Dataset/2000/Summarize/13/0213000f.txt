CPI(M) meeting shifted to Calcutta

A three-day CPI ( M ) politburo meeting , scheduled to have been held here from Friday , has been shifted to Calcutta , touching off speculation that this may have something to do with the party 's difficulties with its ` ` dissenting' ' comrades .
The CPI ( M ) denied this saying that the sole reason for changing the venue was the indifferent health of the West Bengal Chief Minister , Mr. Jyoti Basu , who may have found it difficult to put up with Delhi 's cold .
They declined to comment if the issues raised by Mr. Saifuddin Chaudhury and some others relating to the need for greater openness within the party would be discussed but emphasised that the only subject on the agenda was a review of the CPI ( M ) 's programme which had not been revised since 1964 .
They pointed out that the idea seemed to be use the politburo meeting to project a ` ` united' ' image of the party ; this was easier to do in Calcutta where the leadership had greater manoeuvrability than in Delhi .
Mr. Saifuddin Chaudhury , who has been given a show-cause notice for alleged breach of party discipline , is expected to give his reply before the politburo meeting ends .
