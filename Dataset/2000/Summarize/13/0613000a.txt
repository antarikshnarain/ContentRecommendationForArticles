M&As;: Failures or successes?

M&As ; are justified on many grounds - synergy , agglomeration to fend off competition , mergers to build up global locational advantages , alliances to keep pace with technological change and more .
But in the midst of the M&A ; mania that is sweeping the world it is worth noting that the evidence from the distant as well as the more recent past in the advanced countries is that more often than not M&As ; end up as failures on most counts .
A few years ago , in a volume of essays published in honour of Dr . Manmohan Singh , Prof. Ajit Singh of Cambridge University had pointed out that research on the effect of M&As ; during the 1980s had shown that on the average post-merger profitability was lower than before .
And since after the amalgamation the new firm would have a greater monopoly power than the pre-merger individual firms , this decline in average profitability meant a decline in efficiency at the level of the firm as well .
Last year , the consultancy KPMG in a survey in the U.S. and the EU of 107 M&A ; cases one year after the event found that in only 17 per cent of the cases was there an addition to value .
In yet another survey of research on the effect of M&As ; , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in its World Investment Report 1999 noted that the ` ` strategic comfort' ' afforded by a larger size - protection against takeovers - was what was driving an increase in the number of M&As ; in recent years , ` ` notwithstanding the fact that a number of these deals do not result in increased performance .
