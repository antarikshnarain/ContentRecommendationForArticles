New EC appointed

The Vajpayee government took more than three months to find a successor for Mr. Krishnamurthy as it was keen on filling up the vacancy with a candidate with a legal background and preferably from any of the southern states to ensure ` balanced representation ' in the Commission .
Mr . Krishna Murthy who was to retire in May on attainment of 65 years will retire in 2005 and has a good chance of becoming the Chief Election Commissioner in the course of his tenure .
Mr. Murthy has varied experience of having served in various capacities including Chief Commissioner of Income Tax at Mumbai and Chennai , Director General of Income Tax , Additional Secretary , Expenditure Department at the Centre and an international assignment as Resident Tax Adviser at Ethiopia .
Holder of a masters degree in fiscal studies from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom , he had done bachelor of law with the University of Madras and bachelor of arts from University of Mysore .
Any further delay in appointment of a third Election Commissioner could have led to complications as the Commission has announced assembly elections in four states next month .
The Supreme Court has not only upheld the validity of the multi- member Commission with equal power among the CEC and the ECs but held that all the decisions in the Commission will be majority decisions .
