'No IA flight to Kathmandu without fool-proof security'

India 's efforts in the past to have airport security tightened at the Kathmandu airport ` ` did not materialise' ' , the Union Minister for Civil Aviation , Mr. Sharad Yadav , told mediapersons here today .
However , under the bilateral Air Services Agreement between the two countries , Nepal had disallowed ` ladder-point ' security checks ` ` as with other airlines' ' , said the Chairman-cum-Managing Director of Indian Airlines , Mr. Anil Baijal , who was also present .
The Minister absolved IA of any security lapses at the Tribhuvan airport saying it was the responsibility of the security personnel at that airport .
However , the Secretary , Civil Aviation , Mr. Ravindra Gupta , said airlines the world over were supposed to take care of the registered baggage checks , interline baggage security and ladder- point frisking .
On posting sky marshals on passenger flights , Mr . Yadav said security was a national issue and he would not divulge details except give the assurance that ` ` passenger security would not be compromised'' .
Air India 's financial health was a challenge and IA needed small aircraft particularly to tourist destinations in Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh , but they were not viable because of the domestic cost of aviation fuel .
