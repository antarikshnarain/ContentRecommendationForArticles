`No dumping ground for second hand cars'

The Industry and Commerce Minister , Mr . Murasoli Maran , today allayed the industry 's concerns regarding large scale dumping of imported cars .
Inaugurating the fifth Auto Expo here , Mr. Maran felt the apprehensions expressed by top CII leaders about the future of the automobile industry were premature because there was enough time available to take a considered view in the matter .
` ` One can only say that this nascent industry , or for that matter any nascent industry , which has achieved so much in such a short span of time , can not be left in the lurch so easily .
' ' Significantly , while assuring the industry that blanket permission to import any type of second hand cars is unlikely to be allowed , Mr. Maran stopped well short of promising a complete full stop to import of second hand cars .
Mr. Maran also stuck to this line and while assuring that indiscriminate imports will not be permitted , he withheld any categorical assurance against stopping imports completely .
Noting that a committee headed by the Law Minister , Mr. Ram Jethmalani , was preparing a draft competition policy , the CII chief launched a broadside against some chambers of commerce opposing the proposed policy .
