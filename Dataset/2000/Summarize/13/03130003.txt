New turn in probe into plot against Chandrika

The alleged ` wider conspiracy ' behind the failed assassination attempt on the Sri Lankan President , Ms . Chandrika Kumaratunga on December 18 , has taken a new turn with the island 's police reportedly questioning ` ` the head of a state media institution .
' ' The state-run Daily News , which reported the ` wider conspiracy ' angle a couple of days ago , today said that the head of the state media institution was quizzed by CID sleuths probing the assassination attempt .
` ` The parameters for questioning are the manner in which the particular section of the state media was used to facilitate the plot to assassinate the President,' ' the newspaper said , adding , ` ` the questioning has thrown light on many connected matters and has been very helpful for further investigations .
' ' The ` wider conspiracy ' angle to the failed attempt by a woman suicide bomber on December 19 , as reported in the Daily News and the state-run electronic media , is that sections of the Army would have stepped in in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of the President , in the event the killing was carried out , resulting in a military takeover of the island .
' ' Recalling the President 's December 3 , TV programme in which she named a couple of editors as those who were opposed to her and the subsequent report in the state-media , the Opposition leader said there was a ` ` new climate of repression on media freedom in the last few weeks .
Referring to charges by the President that some business groups were funding the Opposition UNP , Mr. Wickremesinghe said there was the need for ` ` public funding' ' of political parties ` ` with accountability,' ' citing the examples of Germany and the U.S .
