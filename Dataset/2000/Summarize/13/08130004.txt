When will man and machine merge? 

The answer engaged ` ` futurists' ' and computer specialists throughout the fading months of the last century - and at least one expert has laid out a precise timetable for the development : Dr.Ray Kurzweil , US- based Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) guru and Speech Recognition pioneer , in a provocative and prophetic book published last year , ` ` The Age of Spiritual Machines : When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence'' .
He suggests that : - By 2020 computers which have the same intelligence as the human brain - which is capable of about 20 billion calculations per second- will be available for $ 1000 ( Rs 45,000 ) or less : the price of a standard multimedia PC in India today .
If Kurzweil 's predictions seem far fetched , consider his argument that we are firmly set on the road which will see all this happen : Already , we have neural implants - tiny processors which mimic the human nerve cell or neuron - to help reduce the effects of Parkinson 's Disease and multiple sclerosis ; chochlear implants to restore hearing to the aurally challenged.... And any day now , will come , a retina implant , powered by solar cells and connected to the optic nerve to restore sight to the blind , by using tiny TV cameras embedded in special spectacles .
Rather , at places like the AI Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , they are working on robots that can interact with humans through language , gesture , posture and expression - and hope that by manipulating the DNA of live cells and trying to merge such biological processes with computers , they will succeed .
Wearable computers In a purely physical sense , merging men and machines is already being achieved - through ` ` wearable computers' ' - totally portable computers which can be worn like a belt , programmed using a wrist key pad and accessed by a display which appears on one 's spectacles .
* * * ` The human cell is a computer ' AN ISRAELI scientist has suggested that within two decades , every cell in the human body could be programmed to act like tiny biological computers.Simple molecular building blocks - like amino acid -could be trained to look out for hostile bacteria , diagnose imminent disease and release tiny quantities of antibiotic to fight it .
