The advanced jet trainer

Therefore , the advanced trainer has to have similar advanced technologies and be capable of delivering those weapons currently in the Air Force inventory , along with state-of-the-art navigation and weapon aiming systems .
Although some operational training in flying teaching institutions would be possible in the MiG-21 Bis , it would be without the full benefit of quality operational training which can come only from the type of trainer aircraft needed for the purpose .
The lower expenditure is in terms of operating costs as well as in reduced losses in training accidents which would be fewer on simpler-to-fly trainer aircraft , as compared to the likelihood of losses during the training of inexperienced pilots on the complicated and sophisticated operational types .
They have state-of- the-art weapon aiming and navigation systems , can carry the latest weapons , and have all the manoeuvrability and software needed for graduating fighter pilots to fly combat planes effectively .
After the induction of the trainer plane , successive generations of young pilots will receive proper training and it will be a few years before an adequate number of the AJT-trained aircrew will percolate to operational units , improving the safety and operational capability of the air arm .
Meanwhile , flight safety is being jeopardised and operational preparedness is suffering , as without a proper advanced trainer many combat exercises have to be restricted or deleted in the training syllabi .
