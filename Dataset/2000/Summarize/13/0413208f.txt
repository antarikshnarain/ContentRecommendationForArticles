Security rings around monastery

The Gyuto Ramoche Tantrik Monastery here , which was buzzing with activity only three days ago , now presents the picture of a fortress as it has been declared ` ` out of bounds' ' for the Tibetan people and other visitors .
Although there is no official ` confirmation ' as to where exactly the ` ` Golden Child' ' has been kept , it is clear that the Karmapa is recuperating at this still incomplete monastery , located about 8 km from Dharamsala on the Dharamsala- Palampur Road .
A visit to the monastery by this reporter not only confirmed the presence of the Karmapa but also gave an insight into the kind of security provided to him in view of the serious threat to his life .
' Along the steps of the monastery , Tibetan security officials stand guard to prevent any unwanted person from gaining entry into the monastery .
Some senior officials of the Kashag ( Tibetan Cabinet ) are the only ones apart from officials from the State Government and Intelligence Bureau who are allowed to go inside .
One could see another ring of Intelligence officials keeping an eye inside the various rooms of the monastery with electronic gadgets and walkie-talkies in their hands .
