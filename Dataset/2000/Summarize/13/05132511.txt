End of import controls

With all but a handful of countries switching over from QRs to import tariffs , India was taken in 1997 to the WTO 's Dispute Settlement Body by the U.S. which had demanded an immediate lifting of all controls .
Though the shift to tariffs has been taking place gradually since 1991 , the QRs that remain on 1,429 product lines are largely in the ` sensitive ' categories of consumer products and agriculture .
But if Indian farmers and processors are to enjoy a modicum of protection , then these tariffs have to be re- negotiated before all the QRs are removed .
With second-hand cars of high quality available at throwaway prices in a number of foreign markets , imports in the post-QR regime could pose a major threat to the producers - India and foreign - in the local market .
Since India has so far not bound its tariffs on cars , it does have the freedom of setting the import duty on used cars at a sufficiently high level to at least partially neutralise the price disadvantage of domestic manufacturers .
The high tariffs may even have to be supplemented with non-tariff measures such as tough environmental norms and road-worthiness certificates , if the domestic consensus is that the investment that has been made in the local automotive industry should be protected from import of inexpensive second-hand vehicles .
