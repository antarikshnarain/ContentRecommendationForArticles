Malaysia for end to curbs on Iraq

Malaysia today undertook a major diplomatic initiative in its capacity as a non-permanent member of the U.N . Security Council by pledging sustained support for Baghdad in its efforts to secure a comprehensive and permanent revocation of the global organisation 's prolonged sanctions on Iraq .
This was disclosed at the end of talks in Kuala Lumpur between the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister , Mr. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi , and his Iraqi counterpart , Mr. Tariq Aziz .
According to the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister , who stressed the importance of Iraq 's cooperation for the success of UNMOVIC 's mission , Baghdad is currently averse to certain aspects of the Commission 's mandate perceived to be in conflict with Iraqi national interests .
Malaysia 's support for Iraq , as indicated in today 's talks , is in line with recent comments by the Malaysian Prime Minister , Dr. Mahathir Mohamad , that the U.N . had set a bad precedent by holding the people of Iraq virtually hostage in its bid to secure the fall of one person , namely Mr . Saddam Hussein .
According to the Malaysian State-run news agency , Ms. Marina Yusoff , Vice- President of Parti Keadilan Nasional ( National Justice Party ) surrendered at a police station in Kuala Lumpur , facing an arrest warrant issued against her for a speech in which she allegedly made seditious remarks .
