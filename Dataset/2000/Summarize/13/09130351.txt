A classic portrayal

The theatre group that swept Chennaiites a few years ago with their recreation of the flood scene in Mill on the Floss is back again - Shared Experience now brings to town Jane Eyre .
' Shared Experience which has been touted as ` one of British theatre 's greatest survivors ' believes in the idea of story telling in which the inner lives of those on stage is made palpably physical .
When Helen Edmundson , the writer , and Polly Teale , signed up with Shared Experience , Mike Alfreds , founder of the theatre finally had that distinctive performance style he was working for - ` a genuine and celebratory marriage of physical and text-based theatre .
' Among their famed productions are ` Anna Karenina ` , ` Mill on the Floss ' , a novel adaptation of Shakespeare 's ` The Tempest ' and Tolstoy 's epic ` War and Peace' .
Shared Experience will take the stage at the Music Academy , on January 23 and 24 , with its fast paced , sensual , aesthetic interpretation of the nineteenth-century Bronte classic .
