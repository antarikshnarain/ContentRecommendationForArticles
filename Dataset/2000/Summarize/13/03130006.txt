Pinochet may be allowed to return home

This will effectively end the 15-month long legal battle that Gen. Pinochet has been waging to avoid facing trial in Spain for acts of torture committed during his period in power in Chile .
He said before taking a final decision to release Gen. Pinochet , he would give a week for the Spanish judge , Mr. Balthazar Garzon and human rights groups such as Amnesty International , to make any representations against letting the former dictator go .
While the Chilean Government , which has been campaigning for Gen. Pinochet 's release , welcomed the news , human rights groups reacted angrily and demanded a judicial review of the Home Secretary 's decision .
` ` Any decision by Mr. Jack Straw to release Gen. Pinochet on health grounds should be subject to immediate judicial review,' ' said Ms. Helen Banber , director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture .
The arrest was based on an extradition order from the Spanish magistrate , Mr. Balthazar Garzon , who had been compiling evidence of torture , murder and illegal imprisonment during Gen. Pinochet 's right-wing dicatorship in Chile .
The British Home Secretary , who has the final authority in extradition cases , then ordered a medical examination of Gen . Pinochet , following represenations form the Chilean Government that he was unfit to stand trial .
