Russian Dy. PM arriving today

Mr. Khristenko , who is the co-chairman of the Indo- Russian Intergovernmental Commission ( IGC ) for trade , economic , scientific and cultural cooperation , is leading a 70-member strong delegation for a two-day plenary session of the IGC , held alternatively in Delhi and Moscow every year .
Set against this background , the 6th IGC session may be also a good occasion to take stock of the Indo-Russian commercial and economic cooperation during Mr. Yeltsin 's eight- year rule of post-Soviet Russia .
