Hasan Tiro rejects Wahid's offer

On another front , the separatist leader of Indonesia 's Aceh province , Mr. Teuku Hasan Tiro , who lives in exile in Sweden , today rejected the President 's offer of a conditional clemency .
A political version in Jakarta , attributed to a spokesman of the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) , was that Mr. Hasan Tiro would not also attend a special congress proposed by the Indonesian Government for a broad-spectrum discussion of the ways to resolve Aceh 's disaffection with Jakarta .
Mr. Wahid 's offer of clemency to Mr. Hasan Tiro is conditional on the latter returning to Indonesia and pledging to work for national reconciliation in the specific context of Aceh 's grievances .
