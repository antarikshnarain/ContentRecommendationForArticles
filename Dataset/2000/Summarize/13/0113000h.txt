Not projecting anyone as CM in polls, says Cong.

The party spokesman , Mr . Ajit Jogi , refuted the statement of the party 's Orissa unit spokesman that Mr. J.B. Patnaik , former Chief Minister and now the OPCC president , would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate .
Mrs. Sonia Gandhi , will undertake a two-day tour of Orissa from tomorrow to oversee the relief and rehabilitation work being undertaken by the State Government .
It was clarified that the Election Commission had said that relief works by the State Government would not be affected by the notification of the Assembly elections in Orissa and that they could continue till four days before the polling day .
` ` This is a BJP-led Government ; therefore , it is wrong to say that the image of the Government and the country has not been damaged,' ' Mr. Jogi said .
The party also reacted belatedly and weakly to the RSS chief , Prof. Rajendra Singh 's comment that the handling of the hijacking episode was a reflection of Hindu cowardice .
Asked about the party 's stand on whether the 17th Karmapa should be granted political asylum , Mr. Jogi refused to comment on the ground that the Congress ( I ) was not in possession of all the facts .
