Russians on the defensive

Russian generals were on the defensive today after a series of dramatic raids on Chechen towns under their control dealt them the worst setback of their campaign against Muslim rebels .
Russian television stations broadcast reports late yesterday from Shali , a major town in south-east Chechnya which was again under Russian control after a day of fierce fighting .
But their evening status reports said they fired artillery at guerilla targets near Goiti , Argun , Shali and Urus- Martan , scattered across the breadth of the fertile Chechen heartland they supposedly cleared of rebels weeks ago .
