Uncalled for 

IT IS UNFORTUNATE that the country must witness a simultaneous strike in all the 11 major ports and in the power sector in the largest State , Uttar Pradesh .
If the port strike was uncalled for when conciliation proceedings were in progress in Mumbai and the unions called for a unilateral strike , the crisis in U.P .
Thousands of crores are lost every day of the strike and at the end of it neither the employees nor their political masters pay for the losses and it is the economy which suffers .
It has rejected the demands for pay revision every five years ( instead of ten ) and for some allowances with retrospective effect , as it would trigger similar demands from employees in other Public Sector Undertakings .
Reports from Calcutta that the dock workers will stop all loading operations to Port Blair and throttle the supply of all essential items to the Union Territory smack of economic terrorism .
An element of cross-subsidy in power supply may be inevitable , but that must be confined to the really deserving and the poor and it is unacceptable to persist with free power to any sector .
