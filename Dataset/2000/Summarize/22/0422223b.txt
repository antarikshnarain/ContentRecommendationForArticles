A sunny side to policing 

MR. RAJENDRAN , TRAFFIC constable on his beat near Valluvar Kottam , prefers to stand outside the solar-powered booth set up there and carry out his tasks .
It is not that he does not want to use it , and he is aware that the booth is more than a shelter as it has certain amenities such as wireless mike , mini fan and public address system .
This company has come up with a different model of solar-powered booths , which , according to the firm , will provide the kind of conditions that will prompt the traffic policemen to use them effectively .
Mr. K. E. Ragunaathan , Managing Director of the company , says the model of the booths to be manufactured by his organisation and another company , Lloyd Insulations ( India ) , are dismantlable and can be shifted .
The first such booth is going to be installed near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the Marina and the Chief Minister , Mr. M . Karunanidhi , has been approached to making it functional on January 26 , Mr. Ragunaathan says , adding that the support from the corporate sector will make not only this venture popular but also help in creating greater awareness of the application of solar energy in day-to-day life .
Among the places where the police concurrence has been given for installing the booths are the junctions of Sterling Road-College Road , Anna Salai-Spencer , Wallajah Road-Anna Salai , South Usman Road-Anna Salai , V. M. Street-Radhakrishnan Salai and Radhakrishnan Salai-Natesan Salai .
