Bad festival

Stanley Kubrick 's ` ` Eyes Wide Shut' ' , Mike Leigh 's ` ` Topsy-Turvy' ' , Zhang Yimou 's ` ` Not One Less' ' , Mohsen Makhmalbaf 's ` ` Kish Tales' ' and Jane Campion 's ` ` Holy Smoke' ' were some of the unpardonable misses .
Even the only foreign star of the Festival , Ms. Bibi Andersson ( whose professional association with the Swedish auteur , Mr. Ingmar Bergman , led to some great cinema ) , was livid at the way things were goofed-up ; the Festival could not get the motion picture that was the most recent and representative of her work , reportedly because the distributor , MGM , said no , not until the money due to us is paid !
The Directorate of Film Festivals , which organises the annual event , has not been able to shake its image of a typical government body , replete with mulishness and red-tapism .
It seemed such a pity that a former Director of the National Archives at Pune - whose work in the field is renowned - had to knock on several doors for a card , entitling him to watch the closing ceremony .
Much has been written about the folly of not having a permanent address , and when the main venue in the country 's capital , Siri Fort , was recently revamped at a huge cost to the taxpayer , one hoped that the Festival would finally discard its gypsy cloak .
The Indian Festival can not be ignorant of this ; the Director herself visits European and North American destinations every year , where such cinematic events are conducted with not just precision , but with a sense of purpose and feeling .
