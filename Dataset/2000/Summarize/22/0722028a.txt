Exposing the lack of depth 

The voyage Down Under has turned sour in the face of some humiliating defeats and the disaster has led to some startling discovery of the actual strength of the team in international cricket .
The lack of depth in all departments is appalling and nothing signifies it more than the exposure of Vijay Bharadwaj , Devang Gandhi and Hrishikesh Kanitkar .
The selectors did a near-perfect job and if they excluded proven men like Mohammed Azharuddin and Nayan Mongia from the side , they had their reasons .
Of course non-cricketing because it defies logic when someone says that the likes of Bharadwaj , Kanitkar , or Jacob Martin can be replacement for someone like Azharuddin .
Cricketers like Sehwag need to be groomed and the advantage of playing someone like Kartik is assuring that he keeps his place in the side by taking wickets and not masquerading as an all- rounder .
He has been keeping wickets this season quite efficiently and would not be a bad choice if the selectors insist on keeping Mongia out and stop persisting with the experiment of Sameer Dighe and M. S. K. Prasad .
