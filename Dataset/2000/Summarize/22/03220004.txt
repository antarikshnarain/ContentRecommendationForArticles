CDU finance chief commits suicide 

BRUSSELS , JAN. 21 The crisis and scandal engulfing Germany 's main Opposition party , the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) has deepened further , as the person who managed its finances has been found dead in his Berlin apartment .
For many Germans , it is tempting to interpret this as the ruling party 's rhetoric to run down the Opposition party , but it is also a reality that a vast number of Germans are both disillusioned and disenchanted with what they read and hear about the scandal and Mr. Kohl 's role in it .
The former party secretary-general , whom Mr. Kohl had sacked , said that Mr. Kohl should resign his parliamentary seat and describes the current scandal as a ` catastrophe for CDU and Germany' .
' The Green party leader and Foreign Minister , Mr. Fischer , said the CDU and Kohl scandals highlighted the collapse of the ` Bonn republic ' - a reference to the former German capital which is now replaced by Berlin since middle last year .
Many reputations may be damaged as the parliamentary investigating committee intends to call 26 witnesses , which would include Germany 's former longest serving Foreign Minister , Mr . Genscher , the former Finance Minister , Mr. Waigal and Mr. Kohl .
