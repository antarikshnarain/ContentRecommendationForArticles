Strike financed by mafia: Kumaramangalam 

Kumaramangalam , has said that the nearly week-long strike by the Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board ( UPSEB ) staff and engineers has been sustained and financed by a mafia and if it continues UPSEB would be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Restructuring ( BIFR ) .
In an exclusive interview to the UNI , he said peaking power had come down to 1560 mw on January 15 and it is now 4,200 mw as on January 20 which is back to normal .
Assuring that there is no danger to the ` ` Northern Grid yet,' ' Mr. Kumaramangalam said , ` ` northern India has enough power with a high Plant Load Factor ( PLF ) in thermal and over-generation in hydel power .
The UPSEB employees , who are protesting against the notification for trifurcating the State Electricity Board into three separate companies , are ` ` not worried about privatisation but of fixing responsibilities and accountability,' ' the Minister pointed out .
Asked if the restructuring of the UPSEB through trifurcation for eventual privatisation was the only solution for all the ills plaguing the power sector , he said , ` ` this is not the only model , what matters is pragmatism and efficiency in running the boards .
1.60 , Mr. Kumaramangalam said , if DVB ( Delhi Vidyut Board ) is willing to reform through a joint venture system , thefts could be reduced from the current 45 per cent losses which is around Rs .
