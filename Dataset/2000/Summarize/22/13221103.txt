Emerald treasures 

The brownish green bark , reddish green of tender leaves and buds , bluish green of slender stems of creepers , yellowish green of falling leaves make the forest look an emerald haven .
There is a definite thrill in trekking where one can feel the earth and touch the cool gurgling waters of the flowing streams and watch the colourful butterflies , birds and the numerous insects around .
With the introduction of plantations , the forest hills and open areas were converted into commercial centres turning coffee and tea leaves into currency .
Many tribals became plantation workers and slowly the forest land was used , and cultivable land stretched into the jungle periphery .
The lush green growth of the paddy fields is a temptation for elephants and they cross borders causing damage to the fields and often meeting their end .
Every visitor to a sanctuary or National Park must take care to preserve the natural wealth and not turn it into a dumping ground of plastic , bottles or pollute the place with loud music and disturb the peace there .
