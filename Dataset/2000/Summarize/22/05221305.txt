Ridiculous claims 

Some of his statements are factually incorrect : that the hijackers of the IA plane are not in Pakistan , that ` true democracy ' will one day return to Pakistan , that the people are very happy with the military rule and that the Kargil intrusion took place with the full knowledge of Mr. Nawaz Sharif , deposed Prime Minister .
His claims sounded all the more ridiculous because right below the report on page 1 of the interview was the news about a staffer of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad being beaten up .
The front page of a newspaper is primarily for news which reflects the realistic situation , not a mirror of the castles built in the air by a few people .
The General ordering the arrest of the IA plane hijackers and turning them over to India holds the key to Indo-Pak dialogue .
A. S.Chakravarthy , Chennai Sir , - Gen. Musharaff 's blunt remark that Kashmir alone is the root cause of all that happened between the two countries only shows that Pakistan will never be satisfied until it annexes Kashmir .
He is evasive on the Lahore Declaration and dilly-dallies on permission accorded to the pilot of the hijacked IA plane for landing in Lahore or Kandahar .
