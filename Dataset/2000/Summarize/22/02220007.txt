Do not confuse means with ends: Bimal Jalan

In a recent speech at the Administrative Staff College of India ( ASCI ) , Hyderabad , the Reserve Bank Governor , Dr. Bimal Jalan , has placed the roles of financial sector reform and liberalisation of markets in their correct perspective .
There is no doubt at all ` ` that financial reform and liberalisation of markets are necessary , essential and desirable to derive the maximum advantage from the momentous changes that are taking place in technology , international movement of capital and comparative advantage of nations' ' , he had said in a talk on Finance and Development .
' ' Since the RBI Governor was focussing on development issues , he had outlined the long term goals of a successful development strategy as a sustained and rising income for all the people , and removal of poverty , deprivation and illiteracy within a reasonable period of time .
Citing the example of the share dematerialisation facility ( demat ) - a very important and highly visible step forward in capital market reform , he said that the demat has helped investors , the companies , the intermediaries and ultimately the capital market .
Small neglect , large consequences Dr. Jalan was asked to comment on the devastation wrought on a very large number of investors in the non-bank financial sector - NBFCs , nidhis , plantation companies and so on .
Pointing out that despite the growing intermediation characterised by the proliferation of marketable financial instruments , non -food credit ( in the traditional form ) continues to grow in absolute terms , Dr.Jalan conceded that some types of borrowers are facing difficulties with regard to the credit delivery system .
