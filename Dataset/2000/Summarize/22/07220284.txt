Indians squander it yet again 

Only Tendulkar , Ganguly and Dravid have shown the calibre and class required to perform on the international scene and against quality bowling .
The way the Indians batted after the exit of Tendulkar and Ganguly was a lesson for all aspiring cricketers on how not to play cricket !
All that the Indians had to do after that good start was to play sensibly and try to stretch the match till the last over as the pressure was on the Pakistani bowlers .
But the opposition was let off the hook as Razzaq and the tail- enders plundered 90 odd runs from the last 10 overs .
If the Indians were able to restrict the Pakistani total to 225 , then not only would the Indian batsmen have enjoyed the psychological advantage but the Pakistanis would have come under pressure .
If there is a game-plan for every match and if it misfires everytime , then there is something fundamentally wrong with the planning itself .
