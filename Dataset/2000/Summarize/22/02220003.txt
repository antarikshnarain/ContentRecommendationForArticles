13 JD(U) MPs seek separate status

Even as the Vajpayee Government completed 100 days in office , a group of 13 Janata Dal ( United ) MPs in the Lok Sabha including the Defence Minister , Mr. George Fernandes , and the Union Agriculture Minister , Mr. Nitish Kumar , met the Lok Sabha Speaker , Mr. G. M. C. Balayogi , early today and sought recognition as a separate group in the House .
The development followed the Election Commission 's decision on Thursday to derecognise JD ( U ) MPs as office-bearers of the Samata Party and its refusal to take cognisance the ` b forms ' of the Samata candidates for the Assembly elections signed by Mr . Fernandes .
The group of JD ( U ) MPs were in such a hurry to move away from the shackles of the parent organisation in the Lok Sabha that they reportedly woke up Mr. Balayogi at 3 a.m. and sought permission to rush to his official residence to present their representation to enable them sit as a separate group in the House .
While ten MPs were present during the meeting with the Speaker , three other MPs including the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution , Mr. V. Sreenivas Prasad , telephoned Mr. Balayogi and confirmed their desire to be part of the new group .
While Mr. Nitish Kumar held the JD ( U ) leaders responsible for the EC 's action , the JD ( U ) general secretary , Mr. M. Raghupathy , said the Samata leaders had brought upon themselves the situation by not paying heed to advice from friends .
