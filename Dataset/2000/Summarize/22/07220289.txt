Board dumps request for replacement

With the injury-prone Agarkar sidelined , the team management had specifically pleaded for Tamil Nadu seamer T. Kumaran to be flown to Australia to boost the stingless attack .
The selectors , unhappy at the treatment meted out to Kumaran and Harbhajan Singh , were said to be of the opinion that the team management needed to give a break to someone like Mohanty , who had been reduced to a ` nets ' bowler .
In the process , Kumaran , who earned lavish praise from coach Kapil Dev , missed out on the opportunity to play in the one-day series after having excelled in the one-dayers against New Zealand at home and during the tour games on the tour of Australia .
