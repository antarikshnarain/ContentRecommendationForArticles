The Indian 'Open': A Close-Up 

It was when Indian cricket had Sunil Gavaskar , Krishnamachari Srikkanth , Mohinder Amarnath , Dilip Vengsarkar and Mohammed Azharuddin as its bulwark first five - to deal tellingly with the first 75 overs of a Test-match innings before the new ball fell due -that the first 35 overs of a one-day contest fell , dovetailingly , into total- building place , for Kapil Dev to step in and deliver the knockout punch .
The concerted effort - after the way Laxman revealed his ` on-the-rise ' bloodlines with that 167 on the third and final ( January 4 ) afternoon of the Sydney Test - should be to see in ` V.V.S ' the virtuoso with a special spot at No 5 , left open by the fall from dainty grace of Azhar .
India 's legendary opening pair on that 1946 tour was Vijay Merchant and Mushtaq Ali - the two who , a decade earlier , had put on 203 for the first wicket , together , in the July 1936 Manchester Test !
When the grinning Mushtaq let the Cheshire cat out of the bag , as the two walked out to open on July 25 , 1936 , at Old Trafford , Merchant 's response was : ` ` Why do n't you really try running me out , Mush ?
Observed Vijay : ` ` Since you yourself , skipper , have already expressed the view that Merchant and Hazare are the two most reliable batsmen in the team , what about sending out Hazare to open with me in this match vs Surrey ?
In a Test match , the first five - whose job it traditionally is to play out the first 80 overs before the new ball falls due - become Sadagopan Ramesh , Rahul Dravid , Sourav Ganguly , Sachin Tendulkar and Venkatsai Laxman .
