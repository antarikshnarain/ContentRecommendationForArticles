Triumph of the spirit 

WITH HIS thin features , piercing eyes , long hair and that trade- mark beard , the tall , swashbuckling Jerome Golmard might one day find himself in the midst of a French epic , playing the role of a lifetime .
Golmard , who has his arms tattooed and beads strung around his neck , is passionate about alternate rock bands , spends quite a bit of his time playing video games , enjoys travelling and meeting people , apart from being one of France 's biggest tennis hopes.Giving him support and encouragement during the arduous tour is girlfriend Cecile , with whom Golmard has a long-standing relationship .
He was a popular winner.Golmard 's smiling face might mask it , but his career has been one big struggle , and in the Frenchman 's successes against rather daunting odds , one can see the triumph of the spirit .
He triumphed in the Dubai Open , where in an incredible run , he ambushed Tim Henman , Carlos Moya and Nicolas Kiefer , and then made the semi-finals at both Estoril and Monte Carlo , a Super Nine event , during the European clay court season .
One remembers a conversation with veteran French Davis Cup player Oliver Delaitre some years ago in Chennai and he picked Golmard as one of the most promising Frenchmen around .
Golmard , whose younger brother Yannick too plays good tennis , began his quest in '93 like most newcomers , competing in the various Satellites and Challengers .
