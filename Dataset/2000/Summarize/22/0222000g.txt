High-speed Internet highway overcomes hurdles

The recent visit by Dr. Raj Reddy , who heads the U.S. President 's task force on future technology , has given a fresh lease of life to Sankhya Vahini , the ambitious high-speed information highway for carrying Internet traffic .
Aimed at providing Internet access at 1,000 times the currently available speed in Chennai , New Delhi , Bangalore , Hyderabad and Mumbai , the project was held up due to squabbling between the Government and its joint venture partner , Carnegie Mellon University of the U.S . Sankhya Vahini will finally connect 10 cities and over 100 universities and research centres as well as cater to high band- width needs of commercial , manufacturing and financial sectors .
It was originally scheduled to begin in June last year but talks remained frozen following reservations by officials over giving 49 per cent of the equity to IU Net , an associate company of Carnegie Mellon University which employs Dr. Reddy , said official sources .
The association of Dr. Reddy as well as Professor Arunachalam , another don from the same university , with IU Net , was instrumental in getting the Cabinet to agree to clear such a large shareholding to the University even though free real estate and other facilities will be provided by the Department of Telecom Services .
Official sources said the Cabinet was told that the Pittsburgh- based University deserved such a large equity holding because it was among the three universities which possessed the technology for transmission of data at extremely high speed .
