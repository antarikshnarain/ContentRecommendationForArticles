Help apprehend Osama, U.S. tells Pakistan

The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State , Mr . Karl Inderfurth , said here on Friday that the purpose of his trips was to discuss key issued of concern to both the United States and Pakistan , including terrorism , democratisation , economic reform , halting the spread of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as well as promoting regional stability , especially through productive dialogue with India .
The key issues he identified are : the need for cooperation to reduce the threat of terrorism which stems from the region and directly threatens the U.S. , the region and the world which is dramatically illustrated by the recent hijacking , the need for a comprehensive road map with milestones for a return to democratic civilian rule , the need for regional stability and prevention of an arms race in South Asia and the restoration of a productive dialogue with India .
On Osama bin Laden and talks with the Taliban and Pakistan , the U.S. official said : ` ` The message was that Pakistan 's support of the Taliban - the Taliban who harbour and protect Osama bin Laden - is a concern to us .
We urge the Government of Pakistan to use its influence with the Taliban to have bin Laden expelled to a place where he can be brought to justice as called for in ( UN ) Security Council Resolution 1267 .
' ' ` ` With respect to bin Laden , this is an issue which we have discussed many times with the Government of Pakistan and.....with the Taliban....I can not say that we have received assurances in this regard , but we do believe it is important to restate the urgency....that bin Laden be expelled and brought to justice .
Last July 4 , President Clinton expressed his willingness to play an active role in support of establishing such negotiations....as a practical matter , the U.S. can only be helpful when the proper conditions exist and both parties agree that we should lay a role,' ' he maintained .
