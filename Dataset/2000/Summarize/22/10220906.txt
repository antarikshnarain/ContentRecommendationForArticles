Unique spiritual savants

The first kind has very little stock of spiritual merit but they have yearning for liberation and hence require the guidance of a teacher ( Bodha Guru ) who can direct them so that they can progress on the spiritual path .
The second type of spiritual aspirant is the one who has gained a lot of spiritual merit and thus is ready to be initiated by a spiritual teacher ( Avabodha Guru ) .
In his discourse , Sri Sivakumar said that Tirumoolar , a great Saiva mystic , had stated categorically that if the Guru or the disciple did not have the necessary maturity their association would be counterproductive like the case of the blind leading the blind .
There has been a hoary tradition of Siddhas in the Saiva tradition and their origin can be traced to the Vedic times and to Lord Siva Himself .
The Tevaram songs mention Siddhas and the Agattiyar Tevara Tirattu is a manual codified by Sage Agastya who is one of the pioneers in the Siddha tradition .
That he was a realised soul well-versed in Siddha practices is evident from his biographical accounts and also his work which is an inspired hymn of great spiritual merit .
