NDA partners to hold rally in Cuddalore 

Even as the PMK and the Dalit Panthers of India traded charges following the murder of a PMK functionary , the Chief Minister and DMK president , Mr. M. Karunandhi , today persuaded the PMK to give up its bandh planned for tomorrow in the Cuddalore district on the issue .
The meeting of the partners of the NDA , while condemning the murder , decided to hold a rally in Cuddalore on February 2 to condemn the violence instead of organising a bandh .
PMK seeks ban In a related development , the Union Minister of State for Petroleum and PMK leader , Mr. E. Ponnuswamy , sought a ban on the DPI , which , he said , had issued death threats to him and Dr . Ramadoss .
Producing copies of what he described as the ` ` threat letters' ' addressed to a journal , Mr. Ponnuswamy alleged , ` ` they ( Dalit Panthers ) want to eliminate me by accusing me of working against their interest .
Meanwhile , the Dalit Panthers of India , while denying any role in the murder of the PMK activist , accused Dr. Ramadoss of trying to incite violence using the issue .
Referring to the PMK accusation that the DPI was responsible for the murder , he wanted to know if the PMK was willing to take responsibility for the murder of Dalits in Cuddalore .
