Music for the soul... in the other world 

In the summer of 1978 , excavations at the tomb of Marquis Yi Zeng in the Hubei province uncovered 65 bronze bells known collectively as a bianzog and used for ritual and ceremonial occasions , which had been buried since 433 B.C .
During this time there lived a Marquis Yi of the State of Zeng , a wealthy man of status and power who made his home in what is now known as Hubei province in South Eastern China .
he was buried in a lavish four chamber tomb , surrounded by trappings of an aristocratic life - a life preoccupied with the instruments of war , ritual worship and luxury .
A set of 65 bronze bells and a complete set of 32 stone chimes were among the 10,000 items that filled the Marquis ' tomb .
Among the items filling the chambers were an exquisitely carved jade ornamental pendant , an auspicious bronze sculpture of an antlered crane , an ornate covered food bowl made entirely of gold and hundreds of weapons including fearsome spears with spiked edges .
