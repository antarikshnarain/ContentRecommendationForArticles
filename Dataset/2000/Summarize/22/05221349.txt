Restraint, key word in Lama episode 

A New Delhi weekly has culled out a telegram sent by Jawaharlal Nehru to the Dalai Lama : ` ` My colleagues and I welcome you and send you greetings on your safe arrival in India .
` No comment ' attitude There has been no comment by the Prime Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee , or the External Affairs Minister , Mr. Jaswant Singh , or any other senior in the Cabinet on the recent case - except the Defence Minister , Mr. George Fernandes , who on second thoughts corrected his remark , because of the risk of misinterpretation .
The reversal , which at one stage appeared difficult , was brought about by at least two major public references by the President , Mr. K. R. Narayanan , conciliatory remarks by the Prime Minister 's Principal Secretary , Mr. Brajesh Mishra , and the pronouncements of Mr. Jaswant Singh , soon after taking charge of the foreign office .
On January 14 , when the Chinese Ambassador , Mr. Zhou Gang , went to the External Affairs Ministry for a discussion on the subject , the spokesperson gave this information to the Press - India asked China to furnish details about the monk 's departure from Tibet , the route taken by him and about other ` ` relevant' ' points .
In Beijing , the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson repeated ( on January 11 ) the official explanation that the Lama had left Tibet to collect symbolic ritual implements - black hats and musical instruments belonging to the previous Karmapa Lama .
But on the day of the Chinese Ambassador 's call in the foreign office , the spokesperson had this to say : ` ` India and China had noted with satisfaction that a sound momentum had been imparted to their relationship and the process of further improving ties was under way under the framework of the Panchsheel doctrine .
