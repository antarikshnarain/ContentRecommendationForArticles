Lankan cricket on a sound wicket 

WATCHING THE rain pitter- patter during the Youth World Cup Group ` B ' encounter against India at Matara the other day , the Holland team manager said it does n't usually rain in Sri Lanka during this time of the year .
Opatha , a nippy medium pacer and a hard-hitting batsman , represented Sri Lanka for 10 years before calling it quits at the age of 29 , the reason he says being lack of motivation .
He played in the 1975 and 1979 World Cups in England and took three wickets in Sri Lanka 's famous victory over India in the league phase of the 1979 competition .
Opatha went on the Rebel Tour of South Africa in 1981 , which he says he would never have accepted a second time .
Moreover , I had nothing more to look forward to in my career,' ' said Opatha , who later played for five seasons in the Lancashire League and a season in the Irish League apart from the Dutch League .
Men like Bandula Warnapura , Tennekoon , Michael Tissera , Ranjan Madugalle , Roy Dias , Duleep Mendis , Anurana Singhe , David Hein and a lot more .
