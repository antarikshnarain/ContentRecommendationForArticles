Left Front sans CPI(M) readying for battle

Constituents of the ` ` third' ' Front , formed by the non-CPI ( M ) Left parties and the Samajwadi Party for the Bihar Assembly elections , have reached an agreement on most of the 324 seats they plan to contest but it would take them a few days to finalise the arrangement .
Sources in the ` ` front' ' attributed the delay to the overlapping claims by the CPI and CPI ( M-L ) on about 25 seats , and the SP 's demand for more than 50 seats which others regard as ` ` disproportionate' ' to its presence in the State .
According to the tentative agreement , there is no dispute between the CPI and the CPI ( M-L ) on 238 seats with 154 seats going to the CPI and 84 to the CPI ( M-L ) .
