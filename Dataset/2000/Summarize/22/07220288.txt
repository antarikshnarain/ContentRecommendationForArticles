Goodwin helps Zimbabwe score 226 

It has beaten South Africa just the once and although its coach Doug Houghton spoke bravely this week of beating South Africa on its own soil there was little sign of that when the triangular tournament opened today under lights .
In addition there were clouds gathering in the brightest blue Johannesburg sky of the year 2000 as the match began and even the bravest captain dare not risk a tussle with the Duckworth-Lewis rules that govern these one-day games if there is rain .
South Africans ask how Pollock will develop if Donald 's dither over his trip to India turns into a full retirement in the next six months and some wonder whether Kallis would be the new Martin Crowe if he gave up bowling altogether .
The second wicket fell to a marvellous throw from the wicket- keeper Mark Boucher who ten yards towards third man threw down the bowler 's stumps from full 40 yards as Johnson hesitated over a single .
The expression ` Zimbabwe 's aggressive match-winner ' does not spring easily from the keyboard ; such a creature may not exist and against the precise bowling and carefully planned field settings of South Africa neither had the power nor the finesse for what was needed : a destructive innings in the mould of Ponting , Tendulkar or Jayasuriya .
Carlisle , who swept Nick Boje for six was bowled playing inside an ball from Klusener that ducked towards his stumps after he and Goodwin had put on 79 in 17 overs and Gary Whittal tried an inside-out shot in Hansie Cronje 's first over that was caught at cover .
