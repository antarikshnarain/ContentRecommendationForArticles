Pak. backing N-E insurgents: P.M. 

The Prime Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee , today charged Pakistan with backing insurgents and separatists in the North-Eastern States as ` ` part of its larger gameplan' ' to destabilise India and said this had impeded the regions 's economic development .
` ` One of many factors that have impeded economic development in some North-Eastern States is violence unleashed by insurgents and externally-aided separatists and criminals,' ' he told the conference .
` ` But this can not compensate for the terrible price extracted by insurgents and extortionists at the expense of the region 's development or the fear psychosis created by them among the people,' ' the Prime Minister said .
Stating that there was a growing perception that widespread unemployment and lack of job prospects were the main factors behind insurgency and criminal activities that have retarded the economic progress of this region , he said ` ` together , we need to pursue development policies and programmes that generate employment opportunities , though not necessarily in Government sectors .
Addressing the conference , Mr. Mahanta , highlighted the acute financial imbalances arising out of Assam 's narrow resource base and heavy expenditure to contain terrorism and insurgency over the past few years and demanded that the Centre grant the State debt-relief .
Sikkim 's Chief Minister , Mr. Pawan Kumar Chamling , today asked the Centre to complete the process for restructuring the North Eastern Council ( NEC ) urgently for an expeditious infrastructure development of the State .
