dated January 22, 1950: Scientists' role in India

Mr. Rajagopalachari , who was welcoming the guests on the occasion of opening ceremony of the National Physical Laboratory , in New Delhi , on January 21 , said that those who sought to obtain a deeper knowledge of physical science automatically developed an attitude of reverence towards the mystery of the universe , which was the essence of religion .
On the role of scientists and the necessity to spend money on research , Mr. C. Rajagopalachari observed : ` ` If the scientists of India make up their minds they can raise India 's prestige to a degree which will more than make up for any failure of defects in other fields .
` ` There are people who would say , why waste money on costly adventures in science or on fine arts or on tombs and temples and Churches and festivals , when we have so much to do and so little money to spare ?
