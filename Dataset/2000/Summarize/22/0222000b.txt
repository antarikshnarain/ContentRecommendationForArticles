'Promote R&D; activities in telecom sector'

The Telephone Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) held its last open-house consultations here today on issues confronting the mobile phone services such as migration to the revenue-sharing regime and Research and Development ( R&D ; ) .
Though some of the members - both service providers and users were for and against R&D ; , Mr. Ramachandran stressed that work on application level software with the specific aim of providing additional application , could be focussed upon .
On the issue of lock-in period of five years for share holders , there was a general view that this should be continued to ensure the commitment of service providers towards business .
While customers were vocal about lower tariff , the industry pointed out that there was no stable policy favouring higher investments for improving infrastructure .
That confusion prevailed within the industry about the authority 's status was borne out by the fact that there was thin attendance at the meeting when compared to the earlier meetings .
