A blinkered panel

Sir , - The Subrahmanyam Committee on Kargil was chartered only to point out what went wrong , and not to identify who went wrong and why .
After the U.K. 's Falkland conflict and Israel 's Yom Kippur war , enquiries were held to go into the lapses .
In the latter case , the Israeli Director of Military Operations ( who was to take over from Moshe Dayan as the next chief ) was dismissed for just a two-day delay in acting on the intelligence of the Egyptian army which was passed on to him .
Since political or bureaucratic accountability has never been an integral part of our governance , no politician or bureaucrat was held responsible for the 1962 Chinese debacle or any lapses in the three wars with Pakistan or the Sri Lanka fiasco .
