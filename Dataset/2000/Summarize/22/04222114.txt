Scheme to churn out 'little doctors' 

The next time you need to check your blood pressure or urine sugar , help will be much closer at hand than you imagine... perhaps at the school nearest to you .
A novel initiative to train school children on simple aspects of clinical evaluation and management of medical emergencies has been conceived involving various departments including the Planning Board , the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and the Education Department .
As conceived by the project , a core group of children , carrying certificates of the Medical Cadet Corps issued by the city Corporation , would adopt multiple ` clinician ' roles ranging from checking blood pressure of cardiac patients , looking out for classical symptoms of cardiac ailment - such as bilateral odema ( swelling of legs ) coupled with breathing difficulty among members of the family , or even conducting a urine sugar test for diabetics in the neighbourhood during leisure hours at school .
And just like NCC cadets are being drafted into civic duties such as helping police man traffic or assist managers of youth festivals , the MCC candidates would be called in to help out in cases of emergencies such as a flood or an outbreak of a communicable disease or even assist conduct of immunisation programmes , medical camps or family planning campaigns .
` ` The investment on educating a child on these aspects has ample reward,' ' points out Dr. G. Harikumar , Assistant Surgeon , MLA Hostel Health Clinic , and conceiver of the project .
Once the programme gets going , patients , particularly those in rural communities , would be able to get a routine blood pressure or urine sugar check conducted at the local school instead of spending money at a laboratory .
