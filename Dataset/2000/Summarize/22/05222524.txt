Reservation in the private sector 

In the U.S. , to take a specific example , colleges and universities are all by Indian standards ` ` private' ' since they are not directly controlled by the Government ; they raise their own budgets , charge student fees , make their own decisions , appoint their own teachers , and so on .
Since people who have grown up with the Indian system find it hard to believe that such a system can work , it might be suggested here that the American Government fund some specific studies by a combined Indian-American team of largely Dalits and blacks , to genuinely compare reservation systems .
There are many prime-time serials in the U.S. which focus on blacks or other minorities , or even working class families ( Indians may find this hard to believe because those serials shown here are normally the upper-class ones such as Dynasty and Santa Barbara ; but neither has been as long-lasting in the U.S. itself as the Bill Cosby show ) .
In the U.S. newscasters ( formerly called ` ` anchormen' ' ) now include women and minorities in a way dramatically different from 10 to 20 years earlier ; in India while women are quite decently represented , both women and men are obviously overwhelming upper-caste .
In any case , Dalit leaders such as Mr. Ramdas Athavale would do well to consider how community pressures can be built up to act upon the private sector , and not simply make rhetorical and politically ineffective demands for reservation .
And conversely , those who feel that the whole reservation system is ` ` lumpenising government' ' or fear that it may ` ` tear India 's polity apart' ' should direct their energies towards reforming the system , rather than simply denying just demands .
