Overhaul taxation system - DCA 

The Department of Company Affairs ( DCA ) has suggested to the Finance Ministry that the system of taxation be recast in the context of the increasing cross-border mobility of capital to evade taxes and lower realisation due to various concessions .
Disclosing this here today , Mr T. S. Krishna Murthy , outgoing Secretary to the DCA and Election Commissioner-designate , said it would be worth while adopting , on a trial basis , the system of 'direct anonymous taxation ' adopted by Austria and flat rates of taxes as in Ethiopia .
Inaugurating a conference of corporate executives on ` ` emerging challenges before the corporate sector' ' , organised by the All- India Tax Payers ' Association , Chennai Chapter , Mr. Krishna Murthy questioned whether there was a need for a complex system of tax administration and filing of returns when the average effective tax paid was only 15 to 20 per cent and when capital was able to move from country to country to avoid taxes .
Mr. A. C. Muthiah , Senior Vice-President , FICCI , in his address read in absentia , suggested reintroduction of full tax exemption on dividends received from a foreign company so that investments made globally were treated on a par with domestic investments .
