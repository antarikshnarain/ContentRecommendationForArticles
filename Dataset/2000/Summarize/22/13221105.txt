The king of herbs 

The Tulsi plant seen in most Hindu homes , is known as the Holy or Sacred Basil ( Botanical name : Ocimum Sanctum ) .
The leaves of the basil yield an essential oil which contains eugenol , carvacrol , methyl eugenol and caryophyllene .
For severe migraine , inhale the essential oil of basil dropped in boiling water , or drink basil tea .
It is widely believed that the juice of tulsi leaves , mixed with a little honey , taken daily is good for health .
Made with either fresh or dried tulsi leaves , basil tea brings about a mild perspiration and with the addition of a pinch of ground cloves and cinnamon , it reduces fever as well .
To combat a general feeling of nausea or queasiness , try simmering a pinch of freshly grated ginger with a few leaves of basil in a mug of hot water for 10 minutes and drink it .
