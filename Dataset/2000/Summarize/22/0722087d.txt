Machine Gun Kelly triumphs 

THOUGH MACHINE Gun Kelly was the centre-piece of last week 's one- day racing , intense public interest revolved around Desert Lord .
From the word go , Scenic Star found himself at a distinct disadvantage since he could barely eke out from the solid early pace a free running berth of his choice up front .
If he was sensible enough in alternating Summer Mood 's pace to get the best out of Byramji 's trainee , he was equally resilient in finding that ray of winning light on Sinister Minister quite literally at the end of a tunnel .
It was this piece of generosity which eventually helped Sinister Minister , though it must be said to his credit that he was easily the fastest moving at the time even as London Bells was being weighed down by the effort of making all the running .
In his lean and fit looks , Kimono would have gone well with an expert eye but Ponnappa 's charge was certainly not among the first three preferences when it came to the punting section which follows the direction of money .
The price drift on King 's Common may have diluted his chances , leaving this inescapable feeling that he is lot better than his performance here indicates.Ruzzan rode a forceful finish to steer Andretti to a comfortable win in a race which by its very composition presented a look normally minefields present .
