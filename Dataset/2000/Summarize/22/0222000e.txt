'Govt. yielded to U.S. on QRs phasing out' 

As is known by now , India would be phasing out QRs on 714 items by April 1 , 2000 and another 715 items by April 1 next year , which is two to three years shorter than the six-year phase-out period that India has negotiated with other countries .
It now appears that the U.S. too had agreed to a six-year phase- out period , but the present Government could not cash in on this commitment which came from the highest quarter in the U.S . Like the U.S. , the European Union , Canada , Japan and Australia had objected to the original Indian position that QRs on imports from these countries would be phased out by 2005 .
Bilateral discussion with these countries continued for some time and by 1997 , India successfully negotiated with these countries and agreed to a six-year phase-out period ending 2003 .
According to Mr. Chidambaram , within three days of that meeting , the Indian Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation reported to the Government that he had received word from the U. S. Trade Representative that the U.S. would agree to a transition period of six years , but would like to negotiate the front-loading and back-loading ( that is , which items would be phased out first and which later ) and build it into the agreement .
While making it clear that he was not against the decision to lift the QRs , Mr. Chidambaram , however , said it seemed that the Vajpayee Government had failed to persuade the U.S. on the front- loading and back-loading process and made a crucial concession of two-three years in the transition time .
It also transpires that the agreement between the two countries was finalised well before its official announcement by U.S . officials and its entry into force was decided to be a date by which the on-going winter session of Parliament was to be over .
