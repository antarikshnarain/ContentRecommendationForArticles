Born to be free 

Mandela was the foster son of a Tembu African chief and he grew up in a two culture world - that of his traditional African family and the culture of the white man who was ruling his country .
" For the first time , I realised that a black man does not have to accept all the indignities heaped on him every day , that there was another way to live .
Freedom fighters also have to be able to sacrifice some things dear to their heart , for they have little time for personal pleasures , a normal family life and the joys other people take for granted .
In our country today , we too desperately need " freedom fighters " as we are oppressed by corruption , dishonesty , poverty , disease , injustice , inequality and communal violence .
Fifty years ago , the slogan " one nation one people " was raised by those who believed in equality , injustice , in progress and education and a reasonable standard of living for everyone .
" Let me assure you that in the fight for justice , equality , peace and freedom every person has suffered indignities .
