CPI opposes foreign investment in retail trade sector

The CPI has opposed a proposed move to throw open the retail trade sector to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by allowing international retailers like Wal Mart and Marks & Spencer to open their retail chains in India , besides cautioning the Government against permitting tobacco giants including an Indonesian company , Gundang Garam Tabak , to manufacture cigarettes in tax- haven States of the North-East .
Spelling out some of the ` disastrous consequences ' of such a move , Mr. Bardhan said that international retailers with their financial muscle will edge out the small and family-owned retailers , putting 50 lakh retailers and 250 lakh dependents into unemployment .
Adverting to the U.K. experience in this regard , Mr . Bardhan said that it appeared that the Office of Fair Trade , U.K. , has launched an investigation into the operations of these international retailers ` ` about using their monopolistic position to squeeze the customers .
Expressing concern at the Indian beedi industry , which employs over 75 lakh people , being the latest target of the MNCs , the CPI 's central organ in an article has asked the Centre that several big tobacco companies ` ` waiting with applications' ' for permitting them to enhance capacities , should not be allowed to manufacture mini-cigarettes .
