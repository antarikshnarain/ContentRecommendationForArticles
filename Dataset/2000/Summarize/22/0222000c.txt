'Pak. Navy was not prepared' 

The Pakistani Navy was not at all prepared for war last year as Gen. Pervez Musharraf had not taken his naval counterpart into confidence , before troops entered Kargil .
On the contrary , the chiefs of the Indian Army , the Navy and the Air Force took a comprehensive view of all aspects of the Kargil situation and put in action a plan , aimed at giving Pakistan strong signals and even tactical surprises in case hostilities broke out , said the Director-General of Coast Guard , Vice Admiral John D'Silva , today onboard CGS Sarang , an advanced offshore patrol vessel .
The Pakistani Navy was told that it would have to guard against a possible blockade of its ships ; it was dismayed to find the Indian Navy right at its choke points , particularly its sea lanes of communication .
Pakistan 's reaction was rather knee-jerk when it realised that all merchant ships , including tankers , expected to arrive at the Pakistani ports through the Arabian Sea and even the Gulf of Oman , were already under Indian surveillance , particularly by the Dornier patrol aircraft of Coast Guard , he said .
Admiral D'Silva , who earlier commanded the Western Fleet of the Navy , said the Coast Guard patrol vessels and aircraft had monitored about 300 merchantmen - their point of origin , destination , cargo and nationalities of crew - and shortlisted 20 to 25 ships which would have been prevented from reaching Pakistani ports , ` ` had the balloon gone up'' .
