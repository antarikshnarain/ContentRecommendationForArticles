Space launch costs will go down: ISRO chief 

` ` While the cost for positioning one kilogram of material in space today was $ 20,000 , it was presaged that the same would come down to $ 5,000 by 2007 and as low as $ 500 per kg between 2030 - 2050,' ' he said .
The merger of various technologies coupled with the turnaround time of the launch - India presently launches on an average three space vehicles per year - which was also expected to come down drastically would all contribute to the reduction in the launch costs .
Dr. Kasturirangan said the performance efficiency of Indian spacecraft was on the increase - their structural weights for a given performance had gone down three fold , the power system capability was upped by six times while the computational ability has risen by a very high of 50 times .
From development of civic applications such as personal mobile communications at a global level and management of natural disasters to futuristic vistas such as space power generation and space tourism , new possibilities are unlimited,' ' he said .
Through its capabilities for designing and developing world class satellites not to forget applications relevant to societal development , the Indian space programme has forayed into the global space market and fostered international cooperation,' ' Dr. Kasturirangan said .
