CPI(M) allotted 21 seats in Bihar 

While all the major political parties are indulging in a cat-and-mouse game withholding their list of candidates , the agreement reached between the RJD and the CPI ( M ) today , however , makes it clear that the Left parties would take on candidates of the National Democratic Alliance and the Congress ( I ) in at least 21 Assembly constituencies .
The RJD president , Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav , and the CPI ( M ) politburo member , Mr. Sitaram Yechury , jointly released the list of seats the CPI ( M ) would be contesting in the Assembly elections .
Of these 21 seats , the CPI would be contesting either with the CPI or the CPI ( ML ) , both of which have an electoral tie-up , in as many as 18 constituencies .
The CPI ( M ) is contesting all the six seats it represents currently and has fielded a candidate each against the sitting MLAs of the CPI and the CPI ( ML ) in Barauni and Mairwa respectively .
Interestingly , CPI ( M ) too has decided to field its candidates against the two sitting MLAs of the MCC which would have to contend even with the CPI ( ML ) in these two constituencies .
While the CPI and the CPI ( ML ) had accused the MCC of having an alliance with the RJD and the CPI ( M ) , the latter today charged that the MCC was with the former .
