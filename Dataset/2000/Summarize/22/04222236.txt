DMK leaves Aranthangi to MGR ADMK 

The DMK will contest the by-elections to the Tiruchi-II and Nellikuppam Assembly constituencies , scheduled for February 17 , leaving the third constituency - Aranthangi - to MGR ADMK , one of the partners in the state-level National Democratic Alliance .
The Chief Minister and DMK president , Mr.Karunanidhi , who chaired the meeting , told mediapersons that the names of the candidates for Tiruchi-II and Nellikuppam constituencies would be announced after consultations with the party 's general secretary and Education Minister , Mr.K.Anbazhagan .
He did not see anything amiss in the decision that those contesting for the posts of secretary or deputy secretary at district , city and union levels should not hold more than one post in local bodies or cooperatives etc .
It was one of the reasons , Mr.Krunanidhi conceded when asked whether the enforcement of ` one man one post ' had anything to do with the report submitted by the party 's five-member committee which reviewed the DMK 's performance in the last Lok Sabha elections .
On his continued description of the TMC as the Opposition party and not as an ` opponent party ' inspite of allegations levelled against the DMK , the Chief Minister said ` ` the TMC is run by my friend .
` ` I do not see anything wrong in attending a memorial meeting' ' , he said , when a reporter referred to the TMC 's decision to permit the AIADMK to organise a condolence meeting for V.R.Nedunchezian at Kamaraj Hall in Teynampet on February 2 and the TMC president , Mr.G.K.Moopanar 's decision to participate in the meeting .
