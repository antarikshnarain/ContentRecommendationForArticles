Ripping into music money 

Unlike the music from badly pirated audio-cassettes , music duplicated in MP3 form is of digital quality and is convenient to play .
Though MP3 became a rage only in the recent past , there are tens of sites that provide Tamil songs in the MP3 format , that too from the latest films .
Another advantage are the features of new MP3 players , the mandatory software packages that are required to play MP3 in computers , that are now available .
Interestingly , the MP3 songs reflect the market situation and A.R.Rahman is the top favourite , whether it is ` ` Thevaker 's' ' collection ` ` Mohan 's TamilMP3 collection,' ' followed by Ilayaraja and S. A. Raj Kumar .
Almost all Rahman songs are now downloadable and the file size ranges from 2 mb to 3 mb which takes about five minutes to ten minutes to download depending upon the speed of dial-up connection .
If ` ` MP3' ' is the most searched word after ` ` sex' ' over the Net , a query for ` ` Tamil MP3' ' can bring forth a surprising number of sites .
