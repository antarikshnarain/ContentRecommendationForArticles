Thakre may not get another term 

A new president of the Bharatiya Janata Party is to be installed by the third week of May , and now it has become absolutely clear that Mr. Kushabhau Thakre will not be getting a second term , although even under the recently amended party constitution he is in a position to stand for the election .
Two months ago in November Mr. Thakre himself had at first stated that he was not interested in a second term as party president , but a few weeks later he told some correspondents that he would be ready to accept and shoulder any responsibility that the party were to give him .
' ' Yet another reason for the near certainty that Mr. Thakre will not be party president after this May is the fact that the amended party constitution does not allow a second consecutive term .
Although this would not come in his way - for his current tenure is under the old party constitution which allowed a second consecutive term - it is felt that it would be unwise for the party to give a second term to the national president immediately after the amendment disallowing it .
There is also the view that the growing generation gap between the young electorate and the ageing leadership of the party should be bridged by electing a ` ` younger' ' party president .
