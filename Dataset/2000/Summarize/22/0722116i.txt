A saga of determination and confidence 

The agony of the man could be imagined as also the ecstasy when in Lucknow this time Raman gave a new thrust to his career , appropriately in the new millennium , with an outstanding win over a seemingly unbeatable player , Chetan P. Baboor .
` ` I have always admired Baboor 's adaptability , his ability to take charge and change the course of the contest' ' , Raman said , pointing to the way he snatched victory in the more recent SAF Games final in Kathmandu after being under pressure .
On one side was Baboor thirsting for his fifth successive title , coming as he did from Sweden after scoring some spectacular victories over world ranked players and on the other was a rival keen to cap his seventh entry into the final with the title .
` ` I had come to Lucknow a little worried after having twisted my ankle while warming up prior to the Khar Gymkhana tournament which was held just before this National' ' , Raman said in a chat withTheHindu.But on hindsight that proved fortuitous .
` ` I could get an additional day 's rest in Lucknow after the team event and then I also could tune my backhand which I thought was my weak link' ' , Raman said while narrating how Baboor failed to open up loopholes in his ( Raman 's ) game .
Promoted as a Manager recently after being honoured with the coveted Arjuna award , Raman was candid , ` ` in the last ten years Indian Oil has given me everything , made me rise to the level of a Manager now'' .
