Stalemate over seats continues in NDA 

A meeting at Mr. Advani 's residence on Thursday night could not help resolve the differences on seat-sharing between the Samata Party and the Janata Dal ( United ) although senior leaders of both the parties - Mr. George Fernandes , Mr. Nitish Kumar , Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan and Mr. Sharad Yadav - were present at the first meeting which included representatives of three of the four parties hoping to contest the elections under one umbrella .
Mr. K. N. Govindacharya , BJP general secretary , has apparently conveyed to the Indian National Lok Dal president , Mr. Om Prakash Chautala , that he agree to the BJP contesting 35 of the 90 Assembly seats in Haryana as he had himself offered this earlier during the talks .
Senior leaders here say that in Orissa the BJP was willing to share the Assembly seats along roughly the same ratio as was adopted for the 1999 Lok Sabha polls when the Biju Janata Dal contested 12 seats and the BJP nine .
The Samata leader , Mr. Nitish Kumar , said today that his party had suggested 156 seats for the BJP , 108 for the Samata , 42 for the JD ( U ) and 18 for the Bihar People 's Party , ` ` but that was rejected by the JD ( U ) .
' ' However , some senior BJP leaders privately dispute the Samata 's claim to 108 seats , and said that no matter what formula is applied the Samata claim can not go beyond 96 seats .
