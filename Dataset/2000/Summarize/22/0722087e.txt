Silent Force picks the plum 

BY SHEER brilliance of his hat-trick of wins , the first horse of his age group to perform this , Silent Force , a Doaba Stud bred colt , who won the Darley Arabian Stakes has become the top ranked 3-year-old in station .
Trainer Leo D'Silva who saddled this colt is stepping up the pressure for the trainer 's championship when he won the other two cup events to complete a cup treble , the others being Sporting and Fog Cutter .
Of course all the others had similar drop according to the terms , but apparently the mare owned by Mr. Rangarajan had made up her mind that this was the chance of a lifetime before she meanders in the sublime surroundings of paddock and green grass as companions .
With 9 kgs off her back , Sporting shuffled along quietly and kept her 6 year old legs flashing to emerge a comfortable winner over Blitz Craig , who learnt a lesson that the older horses with weight advantage can not be taken lightly and they are to be respected .
Next in betting Golden Hawk who tracked Grey Thistle made his run a bit soon which Ravinder Singh realised by the time he had reached the post as his mount just failed to give that extra - Fog Cutter having only the second run this meeting responded to Moses who carried 1 kg overweight , from hazy surroundings to catch up with the leader and win by a narrow margin .
Second favourite today to the Imdad Jah owned Bold Attempt , the grey with Amyn Merchant took up the cudgel , showing that she does not lack the fighting spirit to freely gallop ahead with tail swishing whenever Merchant picked up the stick , winning by over five lengths .
