TRAI ordinance by Monday 

Private telecom companies were unrelenting in lobbying for the retention of the TRAI chief , Mr. Justice S.S. Sodhi , and the Vice-Chairman , Mr. B.K .
` ` As the TRAI is the recommendatory authority for several actions to be taken by the DoT , it would be inappropriate that the recommendatory authority and the adjudicatory authority are the same .
In order to strengthen investors ' confidence and provide an independent and high-power body , it is necessary to set up a separate dispute redressal body,' ' said the Cabinet note on the subject .
Ironically , in seeking to set up a separate body to judge telecom disputes , the Government used the same stick of ` ` investor confidence' ' which was being used by the apex chambers of commerce in demanding suzerainty for the TRAI over the telecom sector .
