U.S. backs Jakarta on rights probe 

Ms. Albright said the U.S. would be willing to grant Jakarta some more time to try and investigate on its own the allegations of massive human rights abuses by the so-called rogue elements within the TNI in East Timor prior to its recent separation from Indonesia .
The Abdurrahman Wahid administration in Jakarta is opposed to the idea of allowing the U.N. to constitute an international tribunal to probe the Indonesian generals in regard to the recent anti- independence carnage in East Timor .
Ms. Albright 's assurance must please Jakarta as the talk of a putsch by the TNI against Mr. Wahid was traceable to the move for a probe against some Indonesian military officials for their alleged misdeeds on the human rights front over several decades and in several places .
The assurance , the latest move by the U.S. , which first sounded a diplomatic alarm against the possibility of a military coup in Indonesia , addressed the concerns of the Wahid administration in regard to its keenness , as a matter of both principle and policy , about protecting national sovereignty and retaining in Jakarta 's own hands the right to probe its generals .
The U.S. Treasury Secretary , Mr. Lawrence Summers , said in Jakarta during a hurried visit there that the U.S. would catalyse huge bilateral and multilateral financial aid to the Wahid administration if it were to undertake massive economic and political reforms .
On the political front in Jakarta , the Chief of Staff of the Army , Gen. Tyasno Sudarto , said that he had instructed the military and police commanders to take concerted steps to prevent the outbreak of communal clashes in Jakarta .
