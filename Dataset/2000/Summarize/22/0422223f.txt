HC asks Balaji Group chief to pay RBF Rs. 85 cr.

The High Court has asked the Special Officer of the RBF Nidhi Limited , Chennai , to present to the Court , the actual balance owed to the company by the Chairman of the Balaji corporate Group , Mr. Sreenivasulu Reddy .
Contesting the version in a bail application filed by another person named as accused in the RBF Nidhi case , Mr. Reddy said all the loans obtained on behalf of the Balaji Group from RBF were secured .
Mr. Justice P. D. Dinakaran noted that Mr. Reddy 's side had fairly conceded there was a balance payable by him to the RBF towards money borrowed through 42 employees working under him .
The Judge said it would be suffice to direct the Special Officer to work out the actual balance to be paid by Mr. Reddy on behalf of the 42 employees to whom the funds of RBF were said to have been lent with proper securities and report to the court with necessary details .
Asking Mr. Reddy to mobilise the required funds for meeting the admitted liability , Mr. Justice Dinakaran directed him to be available before the Crime Branch Police for interrogation or investigation at the latter 's office whenever the police required his presence .
The police should not harass him and if he ( Mr. Reddy ) failed to cooperate with the interrogation or investigation , the police were at liberty to arrest him , the Judge said and posted the matter for January 25 .
