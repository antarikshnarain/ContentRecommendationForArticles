Israel, Syria moving forward 

Despite a news blackout on the negotiations , a leak to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , saw the publication of the ` ` working paper' ' which Mr. Clinton and his aides had drawn up at the conclusion of the negotiations .
By this agreement , the two imperial powers , the U.K. and France , divided the Levant , with France taking charge of the Syrian and Lebanese provinces of the Turkish empire and Britain taking Palestine ( including present- day Israel ) and Trans-Jordan .
Yediot Ahornot ( though it is considered less reliable than Haartez ) reported that the Israeli Prime Minister , Mr. Ehud Barak had assured Mr. Clinton in October last year that he would agree to the recognition of the June 4 , 1967 line as the border .
If Mr . Barak has indeed agreed to the 1967 borders , which runs below the escarpment of the Golan plateau , then he has virtually conceded the main Syrian demand that Israel return the whole of the Golan .
Moreover , in the article relating to normalisation of relations , Syria ( as per the working paper ) is seen to be in almost total agreement with Israel that there should be wholesale normalisation once other differences are overcome .
But Syria appears to believe that the publication of the ` ` working paper' ' in Haaretz , which was bound to rouse domestic opposition in Israel , was a ploy by the Israeli Government to back off from a firm commitment .
