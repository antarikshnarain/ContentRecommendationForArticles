Contested terrain 

That even in a liberalised environment , corporate firms would not hesitate to make protectionist demands has been shown by the lobbying that the domestic automobile industry has begun against the imminent import of new and second-hand cars .
In the power sector , there is a tendency to blame red tape in the States or ` ` misguided' ' opposition by environmentalists or the politically strong agricultural lobby ( that enjoys free electricity ) for the slow additions to generating capacity from private entrepreneurs and the limited overhauling of the State Electricity Boards .
In a most unusual alliance between Indian and foreign firms , which has broken the barriers between the Bombay Club and the others , manufacturers that have benefited from the liberalised policy on automotive manufacture have begun lobbying against the removal of the quantitative restrictions ( QRs ) on import of new and used cars and two-wheelers a year from now .
Although the details of the proposed ordinance are not clear , what began as an attempt to clarify the powers and responsibility of TRAI is threatening to degenerate into a farce as the Government shows signs of stripping the regulator of authority and keeping all powers in matters of both policy- formulation and the setting of rules to itself .
Yet , this is only an ex-post rationalisation that is meant to protect the position of the DoT which after TRAI started setting tariffs suddenly discovered its social obligations of an expansion of telecom services .
Despite all talk of a consensus on reforms we have here one instance of the Central Government wanting to retain powers that will maintain the dominant position of Government undertakings in one sector ( telecom ) even as one State Government attempts to break what it sees as vested interests that come in the way of greater competition in another infrastructure area ( power in U.P. ) .
