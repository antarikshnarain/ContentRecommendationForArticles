His art has no scale 

Clemente 's association with Frank Lloyd Wright began in Rome in the early Seventies , when he was an architecture student ; and it is only fitting that a retrospective should be held at the museum designed by the great architect , who proved that he was way ahead of his time and conceived space as a " continuous becoming " .
As one enters the museum , one is confronted by the tempera " My House " on the opposite wall ; the bottom half depicts a modern apartment and the spiral staircase at the corner of the room leads one to the next floor , which looks like the interior of an Indian cave temple , establishing Clemente 's association with the country .
Though the summit " Sky " is reached at the domed skylight , there are forays to the sides in " Rooms " and " Books , Palimpsests " , " Collaborations " in the tower galleries .
The exhibition includes works in all mediums and reflect his peripatetic existence with experiences gained in Italy , India and the United States , Michael Auping wrote , " he sees India and New York as offering a kind of helpful resistance " and added Clemente , " so I feel a lack of affinity , a dislocation that gives me room to work " .
" Books , Palimpsests and Collaborations " highlight Clemente 's involvement with writers and poets such as Ginsberg and Raymond Foye and his collaborative work ; a lot of collaborative work from his lengthy sojourns in India such as the " Francesco Clemete Pinxit " made in the miniature painting workshops of Jaipur and Orissa and other works made in Chennai along with painters of hoardings and artisans .
" He has painted frescoes in Italy and America , made woodcuts in Japan , created handmade paper Muslim hangings , miniatures in India , numerous drawings , pastels sculptures ( tin , lead , copper pieces like " Mercury " , " Saturn " .
