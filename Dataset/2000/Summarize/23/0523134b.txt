Walking a tightrope 

While both India and China have so far managed to avoid any serious tensions on the Karmapa issue the danger is always there lurking below the surface , says C. RAJA MOHAN .
A whole range of highly speculative theories about the arrival of the 17th Karmapa are doing the rounds here , including one that argues that it could be a conspiracy by Beijing to destabilise the Tibetan community and put India in a spot .
Sources in the Ministry of External Affairs say the Government has acted with a ` ` great deal of caution and circumspection' ' in responding to the arrival of the leader of the Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism .
Sources in the Government say it has not made up its mind on what it would do with the third most important religious leader of the Tibetan people , and ` ` will not be stampeded into a decision' ' on either granting political asylum or sending him back to China .
Beijing has stated that the Karmapa has travelled to India to get valuable heirlooms associated with the leadership of the Kagyu sect now located at the Rumtek monastery in Sikkim , and that his decision was not meant to ` ` betray' ' his nation .
As the cause for greater autonomy for the Tibetan people acquired a higher political profile in the West and the United States in particular , China is deeply suspicious of any perceived attempt to undermine its sovereignty over Tibet .
