Resurrection of a patriot? 

When Uddham Singh assassinated General O'Dwyer for his role in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre , some condemned him for his actions , while others revered him as a hero and patriot .
For Uddham Singh was the man who " avenged " the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh .
The film , " Shaheed Uddham Singh : alias Ram Mohammed Singh Azad " , is due for nation-wide release at the end of January .
" Thus in Punjab Uddham Singh became a hero and martyr in the tradition of Bhagat Singh .
Babbar , who has himself been associated with the socialist movement , played a key role in bringing together the team which decided to resurrect " Ram Mohammed Singh Azad " more than Uddham Singh .
The film 's severe limitation is that it can not tackle the contradiction between the lofty mission implied by " Ram Mohammed Singh Azad " and the methods of the man who chose to wear this alias as a badge of honour .
