" Vijaya Kalyan 's paintings , in bright luminous acrylics on canvas , conjure up the image of unadulterated civilisation , clear blue skies , bright cotton-wool-like clouds , undulating valleys , peace , joy and human beauty .
Though her father cautioned that she would never make a career out of art , she took a five-year diploma course in the Bandra School of Art and worked as an art teacher for about ten years , her last assignment being with the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre , Mumbai .
" And her love for them have spilled out on the backdrop of richly blended colours against which she has outlined the delighted family , mother and child , the solo nomad in search of his lost herd and the tribal headman seated on the summit of the hill , contemplating the limitless horizon .
She usually does not show a preference for particular colours , unless of course she deliberately does so like in the painting " Between the Two Worlds " , in which she has used only two colours - deep red and a cool blue - to delineate the two faces of a figure .
" Vijaya Kalyan has so technically perfected her work that she can play with any colour but her unusual use of the black line with which she finishes her paintings has made a difference to her work .
