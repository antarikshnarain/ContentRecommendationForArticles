Russia bogged down in Grozny 

After six days of ferocious Russian assault on the Chechen capital Grozny , the rebels on Saturday were still in control of two- thirds of city and even managed to capture a top Russian commander and receive fresh reinforcements .
Russia 's Defence Minister , Marshall Igor Sergeyev , said on Friday that Major- General Mikhail Malofeyev was missing in Grozny.Chechens said the General was being interrogated at a secret location outside Grozny and his testimony was being filmed .
The Itar-Tass news agency on Saturday quoted Russian military sources in Chechnya as saying that rebel resistance was so strong that a daily advance of few hundred metres was considered a success and many buildings changed hands several times .
Russian soldiers told the NTV television that the favoured Chechen tactic in Grozny was to move through city underground passages in typical groups of three , armed with a sniper rifle , a machine gun and a grenade-launcher .
The Novye Izvestia daily said Gen. Malofeyev had broken an order banning senior officers from joining attacking troops because he felt the need to check personally upon controversial reports he was receiving from subordinates .
The TV channel reported that a military transport plane had brought over 140 wounded soldiers to Perm , in Siberia , on Thursday and a second flight with more wounded had landed later that day in Yekaterenburg .
