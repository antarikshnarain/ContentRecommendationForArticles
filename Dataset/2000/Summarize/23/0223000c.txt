CPI, CPI(M-L) reject CPI(M) 'invitation'

NEW DELHI , JAN.22 Differences among Left parties persist on how best to fight the BJP-led combine in Bihar with the CPI and the CPI ( M-L ) today rejecting the CPI ( M ) 's ` ` invitation' ' to them to join the alliance it has formed with the Rashtriya Janata Dal for next month 's assembly elections .
On the contrary , they wanted the CPI ( M ) to review its own decision to stay out of the ` ` third' ' front comprising the CPI , the CPI ( M-L ) , the Forward Bloc , the RSP and Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav 's Samajwadi Party .
Even as the CPI ( M ) argued that Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav 's RJD was the best bet to check the BJP and its allies and that all ` ` secular' ' forces should strengthen Mr. Yadav 's hands , its other Left allies were of the view that aligning with Mr. Yadav would help the BJP .
` ` The RJD is responsible for anarchy and lawlessness in the state which strengthened the BJP , and therefore we do n't think you can contain the BJP with Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav 's help' ' , he said .
