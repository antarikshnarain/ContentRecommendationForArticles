Joyless cinema, listless fare 

And this does make " life " a " whistle " , although the director - who once worked with Tomas Alea and was deeply influenced by him - says that there is something profound about our existence .
Hunt Hoe gets father-in-law Mohan Agashe to paw his celluloid daughter-in-law , Nandana Dev Sen , and when the scandal blows up , there is not even regret and repentance in " Seducing Maarya " .
In yet another work , Om Puri beats up his screen wife in " East is East " ( Damien O ' Donnell ) and acts the tyrant , but at the end of it , there is nothing to indicate that he has mellowed .
Peirce does admit that there is a fine line between what can brutalise an audience , and what can humanise them , and though I did not quite cherish some of the scenes in this picture , it will be unfair to say that Peirce had not handled the subject with some abject sensitivity .
This means no artificial props , no artificial lighting , hand-held camera and so on , and " Mifune " sends its protagonist , a newly wedded man , into the country to tidy up the place after his father 's death .
It says : " Mifune 's claim to chastity is more a publicity stunt.. . For , if the manifesto were a critique of Hollywood or of anything else , the manifesto 's eighth rule ( " Genre films are unacceptable " ) would surely disallow any story centred on a whore-with-a-heart-of-gold.. .
