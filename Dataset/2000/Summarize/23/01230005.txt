Goh for Asian free trade zone 

Asia must think of a ` ` free trade area' ' to avoid being marginalised because of the goings on in other parts of the world , the Singapore Prime Minister , Mr. Goh Chok Tong , said today .
In an interview to The Hindu at the end of his six-day visit to India , Mr. Goh said , ` ` It was your Finance Minister 's idea and my argument was that the WTO free trade regime was preferable .
' ' He said that the North American Free Trade Area ( NAFTA ) could expand to cover the Americas and that the European Community was expanding to include other countries .
Now that the crisis is over , I think both sides must begin to nurture our cordial relations and turn it to something much stronger .
' ' If India pushed ahead with the second generation reforms and opened up its economy , besides increasing its trade with the ASEAN , the time would come to invite India to a summit of ASEAN leaders , Mr. Goh said .
If India opens up and there is a increase in trade between India and the ASEAN , I think a dialogue is called for at our regular summits .
