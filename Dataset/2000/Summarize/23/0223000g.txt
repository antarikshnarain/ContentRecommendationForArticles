Mounds of wheat lying unused

The Government is sitting on mounds of wheat , incurring heavy carrying costs , but is still far from taking a decision on enhancing the allotment from 10 kg per family of four under the Targeted Public Distribution System ( TPDS ) .
Storage is a problem and offtake under the open market sale is no great shakes , yet the Government is still working out various scenarios to reduce wheat stocks .
Besides wheat stocks , the Government is saddled with 24 lakh tonnes of relaxed specification rice ` ` with compromised quality , procured under pressure' ' , the Union Minister for Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs , Mr. Shanta Kumar , said here today , while reviewing 100 days of his Ministry ' functioning .
The Secretary , Mr. M. D. Asthana , claimed that the foodgrain losses at 0.43 per cent were the lowest in the world , while the 1.14 per cent loss in transit was also not much given the scale of operations .
The Government was examining the possibility of making Indian wheat competitive in the world market particularly since other countries provided subsidies not only on production but on exports too making international wheat prices lower than domestic wheat .
Mr. Kumar said it had been decided to impose release quota and levy restrictions on imported sugar , although sugar imports had declined since the import duty was raised to 40 per cent .
