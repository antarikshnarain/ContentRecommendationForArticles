Underworld at it again?

Is the underworld once again amidst the film world here , using its muscle power and even guns , to drive good bargains or extort money ?
After his new box-office hit , Kaho na.... pyar hai , Mr. Roshan is said to have received threats and demands from some unidentified persons .
Mr. Roshan himself has had security cover in the past , which was later withdrawn - it is not clear whether he wanted it to be removed or the police felt , according to its assessment , it was not required , and so had several others but there has been a tremendous strain on the police force on account of inadequate manpower .
Though the trade in general likes to deny it is a widespread practice , the underworld has been funding film production .
