Cronje in full flow; 6-wkt win for South Africa

This odd omen brought the return to form of the South African captain Hansie Cronje who made an undefeated top score of 83 as South Africa won by six wickets .
A Cronje full of runs is an urgent need if South Africa is to replace Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes in the near future and two successive noughts in Tests were unwanted signs .
Gibbs had made a fitful start but it required a steady hand to see South Africa to victory over Zimbabwe 's 226 and Cronje had looked as steady as a sailor on shore-leave throughout five Tests against England .
Once he had steered his way through the 5,000 barrier we saw the full range of Cronje shots : deft footwork to the spinners , a crashing pull off seamer Gary Brent , regular placements on both sides of the wicket .
South Africa had 98 after 20 overs , 150 in 30 - from a Gibbs ' straight six off Andy Whittall - and forced Andy Flower to spread his fielders as far as he could by law .
