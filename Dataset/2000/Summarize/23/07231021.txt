Molik's power-play boomerangs against Hingis 

It is quite likely that Alicia Molik , a 6 ft tall teenager from this city , will sit up in her bed tonight and wonder if she allowed herself to be used on her country 's most famous tennis stage , the Rod Laver Arena .
For , when you are inexperienced and you have the uneviable task of having to face Martina Hingis in a Grand Slam tournament match , you do n't need to worry so much about the weapons of kill that your famous opponent might bring to court as about how to protect your own ammunition from being snatched away by the Swiss Miss .
` ` With Martina , you always expect a better ball to come back at you and that extra bit of pressure threw me off a little,' ' said Molik , who lost for the second time in two weeks - she was beaten by Hingis last week at Sydney - to the world champion .
