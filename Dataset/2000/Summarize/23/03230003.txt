Pak. plays down U.S. statement 

Americans are concerned about terrorism as a ` ` global phenomenon' ' , a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said in response to the strong statement of concern from the U.S. on Friday about terrorist groups operating from Pakistani soil .
The U.S. fears the safety of its nationals living in Pakistan - groups like the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and the Lashkar-i-Taiba have repeatedly threatened American nationals - so , the American statement is rooted in its own concerns .
However , when a senior U.S. official says that the ` ` presence and activities of these ( extremist ) groups gives Pakistan a bad international opinion in the world community and thus works against Pakistan 's national interest' ' , it is time for Islamabad to sit up and take notice .
If , however , Pakistan takes a business-as-usual approach to the American concerns on terrorism , then it is in danger of losing further face with the international community , particularly the U.S . As of now , extremist groups have open offices across Pakistan .
PTI reports : Concerned over Pakistan 's support to Afghanistan 's Taliban regime , ` ` which harbours and protects' ' Osama Bin laden , the U.S . today asked Islamabad to ` ` use its influence' ' with the religious militia to have the Saudi dissident expelled from Afghanistan and take him to a place ` ` where he can be brought to justice'' .
