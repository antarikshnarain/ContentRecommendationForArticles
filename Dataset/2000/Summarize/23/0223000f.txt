Repayment of rural power loans on States

In a significant policy change , the Central Government has decided to make States responsible for repaying Central loans extended for rural electrification programmes .
So far , a portion of the normal Central assistance to States was earmarked for rural electrification under the Minimum Needs Programme and released by the Union Finance Ministry as a 100 per cent loan .
