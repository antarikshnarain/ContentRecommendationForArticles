EC's order, a blessing in disguise for Samata

The Samata Party today asserted its stature to the Janata Dal ( U ) in the tussle between the two for supremacy in the Gangetic plains of north and central Bihar , which accounts for two-thirds of seats in the Bihar Assembly .
The Election Commission 's order was a blessing in disguise for the Samata Party as it had been trying to free itself from the JD ( J ) ever since the Lok Sabha elections .
The Samata Party has been nervous over the merger moves , which it had agreed to under pressure , as it had dwarfed its status as a major political party and prevented it from emerging as the alternative to the ruling RJD in the State .
That is precisely why the Samata Party had insisted that if the two parties were supposed to contest as a single entity then Assembly elections should be contested under its symbol and that the Defence Minister , Mr. George Fernandes , be made the new president .
The Samata Party 's separation from the JD ( U ) was hastened by the coming together of some leaders of the JD ( U ) with the former Union Minister , Mr. Rama Krishna Hegde , which had made things a bit uneasy for Mr. Fernandes .
The point is that the BJP would be contesting no less than 70 of the 82 seats in South Bihar and would not be contesting more than 90 seats in the plains which account for 242 seats .
