British General's visit to Pak. jeopardises jet deal with India

A 500-million pound contract from the Indian Air Force for 60 British Hawk advanced jet trainers has been jeopardised by a visit of Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie , Chief of the U.K. 's Defence Staff , to Pakistan .
A final decision in favour of British Aerospace Systems ( BAe ) , makers of the Hawk , had been expected this month , but the entire contract process has now been delayed for months as the tendering is subjected to a full review .
No military export licences have been issued since October last year , following Gen. Pervez Musharraf 's coup , although DTI officials said Britain had placed no arms embargo on Islamabad .
The Standing Committee on Defence wants India to consider other aircraft , in particular the Russian Yak 130 , the Italian Aermacchi , the Spanish Casa , and models from Brazil and Argentina , none of which was available when the original tenders were invited .
BAe tendered for the order in 1985 along with one other company , Dassault Aviation , a French consortium which stopped production of its rival Alpha jet in 1986 .
One member of the standing committee was quoted Friday as saying : ` ` Since the French company stopped producing its [ trainers ] , it is clear that the real negotiations are being carried out only with the British .
