'HC committed grave error in TANSI case' 

169 IPC ( public servant unlawfully buying or bidding for property ) was made out as the respondent ( Ms. Jayalalitha , who was the Chief Minister then ) was prohibited by the Code of Conduct for Ministers framed through a G.O .
The HC had committed a ` ` grave error' ' in holding that the bar under the Code could not operate as statutory provisions against the respondent and in such circumstances , it could not be legally presumed that there were sufficient materials to frame charges against her .
The SLP said the HC had failed to note that the Code for Ministers exercising powers under Article 166 ( Conduct of business of the Government of a State ) of the Constitution read with Articles 154 and 162 ( dealing with Executive Power and its extent ) was a law within the meaning of Article 13 ( 3 ) and legally binding and enforceable in law .
The SLP pleaded that serious questions of law had to be determined by the apex court , namely whether the Code did not bear the teeth of a statute and it was merely departmental instructions which were neither law within the meaning of Article 13 ( laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights ) nor it was a ` ` procedure established by law' ' within the meaning of Article 21 ( protection or life and personal liberty ) ; whether any breach of the Code by a public servant would not amount to an offence under Sec .
The SLP further said that it was also to be determined by the apex court whether the HC was right in discharging the respondent when the prosecution evidence had almost been completed before the trial court ; whether the sale of Government land for value less than the guideline rates and collection of stamp duty lower than the recommended guideline value would not attract offences of cheating and misappropriation and whether there could not be any charge framed for offence under Sec .
The Tamil Nadu Government is also likely to file another SLP next week challenging the judgment of the Madras HC upholding the trial court 's order discharging Ms. Jayalalitha from the ` ` coal import case'' .
