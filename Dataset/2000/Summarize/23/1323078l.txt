Harnessing energy for the disabled 

During her young days , DR. BLOSSOM RODRIGUEZ used to hate the life in Kalpakkam , then a forlorn village which housed the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research .
Eighteen mentally disabled children and ` ` MEHATVA,' ' where they are learning to be independent ` ` without fear and without being laughed at' ' have become a part of her life and have made the once-hated township dear to her .
Blossom Rodriguez BEFORE THE Women 's Association for Children in Kalpakkam township of the Atomic Energy Department started its special school in an ` ` aluminium hut,' ' in 1994 , there was absolutely no facility in the region to help mentally disabled children .
The eighteen children at the school are now being trained in functional abilities like managing their lives without external support , cooking , shopping , cleaning and a series of things , which may appear simple to the normal world but are capable of changing the quality of their lives for ever .
Though Ms. Rodriguez is grateful to the Nuclear Power Corporation ( NPC ) , 35 individuals and the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research ( IGCAR ) for their support to the institution , Dr. P . Jeyachandran , a renowned psychologist in the field of mental retardation , deserves special mention .
Similarly , the Madhuram Narayanan Centre for Exceptional Children in Chennai also extends its professional expertise in training children with mental disabilities and developmental delays and also professionals and para-professionals .
