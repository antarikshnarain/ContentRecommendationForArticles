PM announces Rs.10,271-cr. package for North-East

Later , answering questions at a press conference at the Raj Bhavan here , Mr. Vajpayee explained that some of the projects included in the new package would be financed out of the plan allocation , while funds for some others would be made available from outside the Tenth Plan .
However , a close scrutiny of the new package reveals that some of the schemes - like fencing and construction of roads on the Indo- Bangladesh border - are ongoing projects while some others , like Rs .
However , monitoring the progress of work on different projects will be done by the Prime Minister 's Office ( PMO ) as the Prime Minister himself will oversee development and anti-insurgency exercises in the North-East .
The Prime Minister 's public meeting at the Polo Grounds here this afternoon was rather a poor show by the ruling combine of UDP and BJP , as only about five thousand people turned up to hear Mr . Vajpayee .
PTI reports : On security-related expenditure ( SRE ) , the Prime Minister assured that the Centre would further expand the list of items of expenditure incurred by the police eligible for reimbursement .
It would include 50 per cent cost of petrol , oil and lubricants , he said and added village guards , village defence committees and houseguards would be extended to Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh .
