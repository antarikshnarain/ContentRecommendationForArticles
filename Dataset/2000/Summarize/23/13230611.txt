Pollution is snuffing us out 

That Shillong is the only town where the air quality in terms of suspended particulates - the most threatening air pollutant in Indian cities - was clean round the year and there was no single day either when the air became even moderately polluted .
In 33 cities , that is , in about half of all the cities monitored , the air was critically polluted round the year and they had days when the air quality was nothing short of disastrous ( see Table : Air Quality in Indian cities in 1997 ) .
While it is indeed one of the most polluted cities in the world - the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) monitors the air quality in about 20 cities of the world and Delhi indeed figures high on that list - Delhi is not one of the most polluted cities in India , according to the data collected by the CPCB .
Lucknow 2,339 ug/cum , Kanpur 1,385 ug/cum , Chandigarh 1,254 ug/cum , Alwar 1,237 ug/cum , Patna 1,229 , Agra 1,222 ug/cum and Ankleshwar 1,198 ug/cum .
But neither do our politicians nor do our bureaucrats have any idea of how to do this - the pollution control bureaucracy is today one of the most pathetically incompetent bureaucracies in the country - and nor does the government want to do anything - the polluter-politician- bureaucrat nexus being extremely strong .
But , to meet the needs of the poor , the government will have to invest heavily to treat the polluted waters to turn them into drinking water quality - and if , however , the government fails to do so because of lack of money or political will , as it is already doing so - then it is the poor who will have to pay the biggest price - the price being their very lives .
