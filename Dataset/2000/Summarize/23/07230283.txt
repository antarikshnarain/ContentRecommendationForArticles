Razzaq: subdued and efficient, like the mechanic he is

' ' Razzaq is only 20 and to be mentioned as a ` ` complete bowler' ' must be a great compliment from a seasoned practitioner of the art who only the other day at Sydney got his 400th wicket in one- day Internationals and is 40 odd wickets away from breaking Kapil Dev 's record of 434 wickets in Test cricket .
Imran Khan was Pakistan 's fast bowler and captain who handpicked Akram as his successor soon after he saw him bowl at Khan Mohammad 's nets in Lahore .
I also have confidence in myself,' ' said Razzaq , who has won two ` Man of the Match ' awards in the C & U series , leads the bowling averages with 12 wickets and has scored 110 runs in 88 balls ( 40 off 38 against Australia and 70 not out off 50 balls against India at Hobart ) .
