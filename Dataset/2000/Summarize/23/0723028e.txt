The modern face of cricket

Contemporary commentators seem inadequate when confronted with Sanath Jayasuriya or Lance Klusener or Waqar Younis because they have n't ( with one two hounourable exceptions ) allowed for the revolution that modern bats , sub-continental ingenuity and the limited overs game have wrought in Test cricket .
Both of them can hit straight but they often do this with horizontal bats , they drive through cover by swinging straight but with an angled face , and Afridi plays short pitched balls by squaring up and angling the bat so acutely that the ball slides through slips .
The changing game The straight bat , the long innings of attrition or in defence , surviving the new ball , setting out your stall and playing forever , genuine slow bowlers wheeling their way through dozens of overs , none of these things will disappear from the game , but they are ceasing to define Test cricket and as a result the game is changing .
This is partly because batsmen carry their one day idiom into the longer game , partly because their defensive techniques have deteriorated through neglect , partly as a result of much improved fielding ( more catches taken , more run outs effected ) , partly because glory now decisively belongs to the swashbuckler and the solid anchor is likely to be seen as a stolid barnacle .
The Sri Lankans led by Jayasuriya have remade modern batsmanship , the Pakistanis through Imran , Wasim and Waqar have extended the range of the fast bowlers art and the South Africans led by Rhodes have invented a new orthodoxy for fielding : the sliding , curving stop , the lightning recovery from proneness , the javelin over-arm throw from the deep , the elevation of point to the pivotal status once enjoyed by cover .
The foundation of Tendulkar 's game may be Bombay 's grounding in the basics , but the front-foot pull , the up and over shot that deposits the ball beyond mid-wicket 's ropes , and most of all , that one-side skip as he makes room to pulp the ball with the inside-out drive are tributes to modern bat-making , the demands of one-day cricket and his genius , not necessarily in that order .
