Blaming both the Centre and the State Government for their failure to improve the lot of the cyclone- survivors in the coastal districts of Orissa , the noted film director , Mr. Mahesh Bhatt today said that there had not been any change in the situation in the storm-ravaged area even three months after the tragedy .
Addressing a press conference here , Mr. Bhatt said that during his tour of the worst-hit Ersama block and adjoining areas in Jagatsinghpur district on Friday , he came across the corpses of a woman and a child at Padmapur village still lying unattended and rice being sold at Rs .
Taking a dig at the Government machinery at the grassroots levels , Mr. Bhatt said : ` ` If such was the situation in rural India on the 21st day of the new millennium , how is our Prime Minister claiming that this century was going to be of Indians ?
' ' Mr. Bhatt , who came to visit the cyclone-hit areas on the invitation of Oxfam ( India ) , said that he had no plans to make a film on the super-cyclone .
Mr. Bhatt observed that with their dreams gone , the cyclone survivors could use their anger as a weapon to draw the Government 's attention .
