I could have grabbed power twice: Wiranto 

SINGAPORE , JAN. 22 Indonesia 's Senior Minister for Politics and Security , Gen. Wiranto , who was the overall commander of the armed forces ( TNI ) until October last , has said he had restrained from staging a military coup when he could have easily grabbed power on two occasions in the last two years .
Gen. Wiranto is no longer in active service despite the military insignia that he continues to hold even after becoming the highest ranking Minister in Mr . Wahid 's Cabinet .
The other instance when the Army could have grabbed power was in the face of intransigence by the students who had seized the Parliament complex in protest against Mr. Habibie 's emergence as President in May , 1998 .
Gen. Wiranto 's comments , which he is reported to have made yesterday to sections of the Indonesian media , acquire meaning in the context of a flurry of statements by several military officials pledging loyalty to Mr. Wahid and the earlier warning by the U.S. against military intervention in Indonesia .
