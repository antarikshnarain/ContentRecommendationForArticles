Amnesty in Algeria 

Escape from the reality of Algeria , either in fantasy or physically , might be the foremost thought in the minds of Algerian youth but the Government will know that it has truly won hearts and minds when the youth can be persuaded to stay .
This war of attrition could , however , have continued for indefinitely longer if the Algerian Government had not been able to present the right formula , and at the right time , to swing popular support ( even if marginally ) to its side .
Its basic element was the offer of a partial or complete amnesty to those militants who laid down arms and were believed to have not committed murders and rapes or carried out bombings .
This was the armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) which had fought and almost won the 1992 parliamentary polls till they were cancelled because the Algerian establishment did not want an Islamic force to take over .
They and the Algerian authorities are understood to have been engaged in negotiations till the last minute , with the AIS pressing for a complete amnesty for all its fighters .
Eventually , on the eve of the January 13 deadline , the AIS declared that it was dissolving itself and within a few hours Mr . Bouteflika was to follow by granting an amnesty to all AIS cadres .
