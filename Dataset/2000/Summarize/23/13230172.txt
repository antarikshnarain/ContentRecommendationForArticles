The way ahead 

Following China 's rapid economic growth and the consequent availability of larger resources for augmenting its military strength , the images of an assertive China which will pose a serious threat to Indian security , to Indian interests with neighbours and in the Indian Ocean areas have got further magnified .
Examples from India 's experience of dealing with China , its assistance to Pakistan in nuclear weapon and missile fields , its links with the Myanmar military , the hitherto unchanged attitude over Sikkim 's integration with India , are cited as evidence of a China which continues to harbour malevolent intentions towards India .
Other analysts , while not sharing the foregoing assessment completely , do conclude that China does not deal with India as an equal partner and that it seeks to perpetuate an hierarchical international system , presided over by the veto-wielding five permanent members of the Security Council , who have also proclaimed themselves as the sole legitimate nuclear weapon powers into an indefinite future .
China 's negative perceptions of India , which find articulation whenever bilateral relations deteriorate , include the following : the 1962 armed conflict was entirely the product of Indian unreasonableness and aggressiveness , India is not fully reconciled to the situation in Tibet , notwithstanding its stated policy of recognising Tibet as an autonomous region of China , India is seeking domination of South Asia , such as would preclude China from pursuing its legitimate interests in its neighbourhood .
Indian strategic thinkers could also attempt a fresh look at the nature of so-called Chinese " threat " by taking into account the basic fact that , despite undoubted superior military capability - including a nuclear advantage - China has made no significant military move against India in the last 37 years .
If to this you add the fact that after the collapse of the Soviet Union , much of U.S. strategic thinking came to be based on identifying China as a major long term adversary , then objectively it must be admitted that China has to contend with a very complex external security environment .
