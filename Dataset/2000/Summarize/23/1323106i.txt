Rays of hope 

KATCHAL , in the Andaman and Nicobar islands , was in the news recently when those aboard the cruise liner , " M. V. Swaraj Dweep " witnessed the first rays of the millennial sun in this part of the world .
" Though I heard about the event , I was too busy at home to see it happen , " said a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee , Mariaye , an employee at the rubber plantation processing unit at Katchal .
After the ship entered the Revello Channel and lay anchored between the Nancowry and Katchal islands ( after covering 235 nautical miles in about 16 hours from Port Blair ) the passengers had to do some " acrobatics " to jump on to a floating pontoon and then to a waiting motorised boat to reach the island .
To add a touch of radiance , a " millennium mela " was organised by the Public Works Department , Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration , in the fervent hope that Central Ministers , led by Ms. Uma Bharati , would turn up .
