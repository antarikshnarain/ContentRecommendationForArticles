Samata's approach delays seat-sharing

The Samata Party 's ` ` inflexible approach' ' to the seat-sharing problem in Bihar has been identified by all other three would-be partners in the proposed anti-Laloo Prasad front led by the BJP as the reason for the delay in reaching an understanding , despite several rounds of talks at the highest levels .
Even as the BJP leaders went on record to state that if an understanding was not reached , it would get its candidates to file nominations for 85 of the 108 Assembly seats , which go to the polls in the first phase and for which nominations close on January 24 , the JD ( U ) declared its intention to contest 32 seats .
Govindacharya , met the Samata leader , Mr. Nitish Kumar , and today the Samata president , Ms. Jaya Jaitely , met the BJP president , Mr. Kushabhau Thakre .
If the 1999 Lok Sabha seat-sharing arrangement were to form the basis , the BJP would get 174 Assembly seats , the Samata Party 96 , the JD ( U ) 42 and the BPP 12 .
Mr. Govindacharya today made it known that the BJP was willing to ` ` sacrifice' ' as many as 18 seats ( equivalent to three Lok Sabha seats ) but the Samata must also let go of at least six Assembly segments ( equivalent to one Lok Sabha constituency ) .
