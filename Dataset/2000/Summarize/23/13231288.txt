The ideal husband 

IN one of his columns , American humorist , Art Buchwald lamented that American wives lacked certain qualities of the Japanese women .
Unlike American women , Japanese wives considered it their duty to bathe their husbands and argued that a family which bathed together , stayed together .
Whenever grandmother talked to us about her life , the main topic of her narrative was how she cooked and served hot food to her husband even when accompanying him on some of his official tours .
Grandmother 's duties included reading aloud chapters from the epics daily , checking Vanoli ( the magazine brought out by All India Radio ) for the day 's radio programmes , opening the tops of the various medicine bottles , supervising the daily oil massage routine and also providing the husband with a bit of village gossip .
As soon as grandmother returned from the temple every evening , she was questioned , " Endi , innaiku kovil le yarellam pondugal vandaal ?
I mean , about being an " intellectual " or there being anything " romantic " about household chores .
