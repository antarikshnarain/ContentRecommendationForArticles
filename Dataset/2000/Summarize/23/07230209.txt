Rest puts players in a spot

The long rest that the top three players have had before this Corus chess tournament has not done them any good as they have run into greater difficulties than they would have had this event come at the middle of the season .
Although still undefeated , Garry Kasparov , Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik have had more than their usual share of trouble at the board .
Friday was the second of three rest days and play will resume on Saturday with Kasparov and Kramnik enjoying a one point lead over Anand and the rest .
Kasparov has had his share of the trouble against Piket and Adams and was in graver danger .
lThe standings : 1-2 G. Kasparov ( Rus ) , V.Kramnik ( Rus ) 4/5 each , 3- 5 V.Anand ( Ind ) , J.Piket ( Ned ) , P.Leko ( Hun ) 3 each , 6-11 M.Adams , V.Korchnoi ( Swz ) , A.Morozevich ( Rus ) , P.Nikolic ( Bih ) , N.Short ( Eng ) , J.Timman ( Ned ) 2.5 each , 12 Judit Polgar ( Hun ) 1.5 , 13 L.Van Wely ( Ned ) 1 , 14 S.Lputian ( Arm ) 0.5 .
