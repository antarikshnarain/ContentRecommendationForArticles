Church at the crossroads 

It is , says Mr. Mario Sensi , who writes for Il Giornale del Pellegrino ( The Pilgrim 's Journal ) , ` ` the Year of God , of the Human Being , of the Poor , of solidarity , communion , hope , liberation , salvation , justice , love , trust , reconciliation , newness , grace and charity .
` ` Under this Pontiff , the Church has practised the politics of exclusion which goes against the basic tenets of Christianity,' ' says Mr. Alberto Melloni , Professor of Religion at Rome University and author of ` ` The Election of the Bishop of Rome'' .
His refusal to resign or retire so far has reportedly angered many Cardinals ( they are supposed to retire at 75 and the Pope is now 76 ) and the Vatican 's intransigence on several issues has created the impression that the Vatican is out of step with its flock .
Bishop Lehmann 's remarks he feels are a warning to the Curia , the Pope 's entourage in Rome , and in particular to Cardinal Sodano , the Vatican 's Secretary of State .
If the Pope dies in office as many fear he will ( he has so closely identified himself with the Jubilee that chances of him resigning are remote ) , there is a stipulated period of nine days of mourning before an election can be held .
The German preference for a strong Italian Pope underscores fears that Cardinal Sodano would promote the election of a figurehead from Latin America while keeping power firmly in the hands of the Curia .
