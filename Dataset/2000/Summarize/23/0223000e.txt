No sell-out to the U.S. on QRs removal: Maran 

` ` It is a travesty of truth to say that the Government yielded to the U.S. on removal of the remaining quantitative restrictions ( QRs ) on imports,' ' th Union Minister for Commerce and Industry , Mr. Murasoli Maran , said here today .
He was responding to allegations that the BJP-led Government could have negotiated a better bilateral agreement with the U.S . rather than agree as it had to an accelerated phase-out of all import controls by the year 2001 .
Mr. Maran said that the U.S. had in the course of bilateral negotiations in 1997 made ` ` stringent conditions' ' in its offer of an extended phase-out period of six years leaving India no choice but to continue with the case in the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation .
The Minister was referring to criticism by the former Union Minister , Mr. P. Chidambaram that the BJP-led Government missed an opportunity to strike a favourable deal with the U.S. after a positive meeting in late 1997 between the U.S. President , Mr . Bill Clinton and the former Prime Minister , Mr. Inder Kumar Gujral .
Mr. Maran said that the U.S. in its 1997 offer while agreeing to a six-year phase-out ( which would have meant that the last of the QRs would have been removed only in 2003 ) had insisted that India 's import controls on all sensitive products should be removed within two years .
This , Mr. Maran said , would have led to a front-loading of the lifting of QRs , with the controls on products of concern to India being removed by 1999 itself rather than in 2001 as in the present agreement .
