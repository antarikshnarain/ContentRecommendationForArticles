Afghanistan a haven for Islamic militants? 

Whether it is the long-standing militant movement in Algeria or the more nascent one in Lebanon , those Arab nationals who took part in and got radicalised in the Afghan war are seen to have emerged as central figures .
One of the major militant movements - the Islamic Salvation Army and a smaller faction the Islamic League for Preaching and Jihad - have dissolved themselves and their cadres are to assist the Algerian army in the crack-down .
In fact , after the Algerians began to get the upper hand from a few years ago , it was believed that the leader of the GIA , Anton Zoubari ( a known ` ` Afghani' ' ) , had taken refuge in Afghanistan .
But he was recently said to have been spotted ruing an encounter and it is unclear whether the earlier reports of him having fled to Afghanistan were accurate or whether he had chosen to return at a time when the GIA could emerge as the sole militant movement .
Through much of the 1970s and 80s , Lebanon was wracked by warfare between its ethnic militias - Shiite Amal and Hizbollah , Druze , Phalangist and Sunni - but they had begun to observe a tentative truce if not complete peace since the Taif Agreement of 1989 .
Not many details are known about this new Sunni group but Lebanese newspapers report that it is believed to be part of a loose network of militant groups which have ` ` Afghanis' ' at their core and draw at least a part of their funding from the al Qaeda of Saudi dissident , Osama bin Laden .
