The Karmapa case - wheels within wheels 

Ugyen Trinley Dorje 's arrival in India appears to have triggered powerful and competing forces whose influence goes far beyond the insularity of the Buddhist religious order based in Tibet , writes ATUL ANEJA .
FROM WHAT initially appeared to be a daring flight of a young Tibetan monk from Chinese ` ` captivity' ' , the defection of Ugyen Trinley Dorje , the 17th Karmapa , has acquired much larger dimensions .
Analysts here say that the presence of the Karmapa in India will naturally generate pressures for his transfer to the sensitive border State of Sikkim as the Kagyu sect is headquartered in the Rumtek monastery there .
The Chinese authorities , the Dalai Lama and the Tai Situ had accepted Ugyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa .
Thaye Dorje , whom he ` ` discovered' ' as the reincarnation of the 16th Karmapa in Bhutan , was enthroned as the 17th Karmapa in a monastery in Delhi in 1994 .
Analysts point out that in the absence of Ugyen Trinley Dorje - officially recognised as the 17th Karmapa by China - the legitimacy of Beijing 's rule in Tibet , to that extent , gets compromised .
