Pak. again fails to become IORARC member

Pakistan has once again failed in its attempt to become a member of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation ( IORARC ) , with the member-countries rejecting that it had not complied with the principles of the grouping .
The association 's charter supports the principle of global trade liberalisation consistent with WTO principles and it stands committed to the principle of non-discriminatory treatment to all member-countries in respect of giving the MFN status .
