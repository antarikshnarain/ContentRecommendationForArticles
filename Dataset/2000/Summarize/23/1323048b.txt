A mandala for well-being 

To make this well-being journey easier , I have devised a sort of well-being mandala for you to imagine , draw or otherwise get creative with , and chart your progress .
By shading in the various spokes of the wheel , your wheel will evolve into a colourful pictogram that depicts exactly where you are focusing your time and energy , and where you may need to give more attention .
Once you have made an effort to redirect your efforts , re-draw your wheel every few months to get a new visual symbol of your well-being .
