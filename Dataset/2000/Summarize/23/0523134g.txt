Braving the brasshats 

Either way , the warning by the U.S. to the Indonesian generals against any power-grab attempt set the stage for a flurry of reality checks in Jakarta , despite Mr. Wahid 's characteristic twin moves of appreciating Washington 's concern and asserting that Indonesia 's politics would remain its own internal matter .
By this weekend , as some key Indonesian military commanders pledged their allegiance to Mr. Wahid 's civilian administration , the U.S. could evidently pat itself on the back for playing a constructive role in South East Asia as a ` ` preponderant power' ' ( scholar Stephen Walt 's phrase ) .
While the last word has certainly not been said on the durability of an emerging democratic ethos in Indonesia , the rumours of a possible putsch by the army waned as a result of a few deft moves by Mr. Wahid and the circumstantial challenges of toppling an untested but democratically-elected Government , if that had really been the design of the Indonesian military establishment ( TNI ) .
Known in local parlance as KPP-HAM , this panel , working within the framework of the National Human Rights Commission , took the extraordinary step of interrogating Gen. Wiranto , formerly the TNI 's overall commander and at present the Senior Minister for Politics and Security Affairs under Mr. Wahid .
This move by Mr. Wahid fully reflected Indonesia 's popular sentiments at this time , despite Gen. Wiranto 's singular contribution of having acted in a democracy-friendly manner in allowing what purists regarded as that country 's first ` ` genuine' ' general election last June .
The significance of that warning is now being acknowledged in a social milieu defined by the angst of the avant-garde democrats in regard to the suspected human rights violations by the TNI across Indonesia in the past and the fears about the military 's potential for similar acts in the future .
