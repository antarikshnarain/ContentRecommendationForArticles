Centre to go ahead with Constitutional reforms: Jethmalani 

He was inaugurating a symposium on ` ` Does the Constitution need any change - if so , what and why' ' , organised by the Kerala chapter of the Indian Association of Lawyers here this evening .
The Minister said that as the nodal agency for implementing constitutional reforms , his Ministry had already prepared the terms and conditions of the Constitutional Review Committee , the tentative formation of the committee members and the time frame within which the reforms should be implemented .
The National Judiciary Commission is being proposed to alter these anomalies and he recalled that he had introduced a Private Member 's Bill in Parliament long back , but it met the same fate as all private members ' bills languishing in the archives .
They are : when the existing provisions in the Constitution do not give any firm guideline to a newly-developed situation ; when the courts interpret or misinterpret the constitutional provisions whose implementation result in manifest public mischief ; when a part or provision of the Constitution , which is based upon fundamental philosophy , is found increasingly abandoned by the people .
This doctrine covered almost 85 to 90 per cent of the Constitution and what the proposed constitutional reforms committee intends to do was only to deal with the remaining 10 to 15 per cent of the constitutional provisions .
The Advocate General , Mr. M. K. Damodaran , the senior lawyer , Mr. K. Chandrasekharan , the secretary of Indian Association of Lawyers , Mr. S. Parameswaran , the former judge , Mr. T. Chandrasekhara Menon , and the joint secretary , Mr. A . Jaysankar of the association were among those who spoke at the symposium .
