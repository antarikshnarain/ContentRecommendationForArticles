Tailored perfection 

Small wonder , when their beauty conforms so closely to prescribed norms that have experts working on their teeth , hair , figure , posture , skin and presence including their " inner beauty " .
India Today 's cover story for December 20 , 1999 , describes the various inputs in producing " the complete woman " : dentists push the gums up to avoid gummy smiles , align the teeth by sawing off rough edges , surgically reshape jaws and artificially whiten teeth ; the cosmetic surgeon provides dermabrasion to slough off dead skin , rhinoplasty for sharp and straight noses , surgery for perfect chins , silicon injections for a sexy pout of the lips ; then comes the fitness expert who creates " a more sculpted look " with muscle toning and weight training , increases the bustline with a machine that builds up tissue in the breasts and uses liposuction to remove flab and then the etiquette teacher rounds off everything by helping the candidate to be focussed , achieve grace through dance training and inner beauty through mantras , meditation and Vedic diets .
" Cottle says , " You do n't have to be a rabid feminist to understand the downside of encouraging females to view nice teeth and glossy hair as indicative of a person 's worth .
" With India edging out Venezuela in the beauty sweepstakes , not only are all the vested interests delirious at the prospect of continuing to design winning products and raking in the profits , but the desire to win fame and fortune by this route is spreading to smaller towns and younger generations caught by the bug of " attaining beauty " .
Wo n't the spending of so much time and effort to enhance a natural attribute and turn it into a money spinner divert young minds from more worthwhile pursuits , undermine their self confidence and engage their time inordinately in the pursuit of beauty ?
Not forgetting older women tracing every wrinkle on their faces and rushing off to seek remedies out of the shiny jars in the supermarkets... . An important element of feminist discourse has been the danger of fragmentising of women 's bodies ( and of social roles too though that is the subject of another article ) .
