TMC charge on books purchase

The TMC has charged that the State Government had not followed the rules in the purchase of books for the newly opened Valluvar libraries in the State .
In a statement today , Mr. Peter Alphonse , MP and general secretary of the party , said that for the annual purchase of books for the libraries , the Government had adopted the practice of getting the price list from all the publishers and a 25-member expert committee would choose the titles and also fix the price for the books intended to be purchased .
The TMC had received information that the Government had purchased the books from five publishers at prices quoted by them .
This alleged irregularity had taken place at a time when the panchayats and town panchayats in the State were passing through severe financial crisis due to non-flow of funds and grants from the State Government .
Those , who had supplied milk to the cooperative societies , had not received their dues and several drinking water supply and augmentation schemes could not be pushed through due to want of funds , he said .
