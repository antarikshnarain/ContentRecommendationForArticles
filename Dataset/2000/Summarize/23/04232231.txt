CM seeks Singapore's help 

The Chief Minister , Mr. M. Karunanidhi , today sought the involvement of Singapore in improving port facilities in the State , while the Singapore Prime Minister , Mr. Goh Chok Tong , proposed a role for his country in expanding polytechnic education in Tamil Nadu .
During his discussions with Mr. Goh , who was accompanied by a 43- member delegation , Mr. Karunanidhi referred to the State Government 's proposal to develop a medium-sized port at Cuddalore and said this could be considered for further development based on a government-to-government agreement or with private sector companies in Singapore .
Mr. Karunanidhi offered to allot well-developed land on the outskirts of Chennai with world-class infrastructure for locating Singapore companies , for which purpose he would approach the Central Government to grant the Free Trade Zone ( FTZ ) status .
Expressing appreciation of the efforts made by Tamil Nadu to build human resources in the information technology ( IT ) sector , Mr. Goh said the proposed ` ` information backbone' ' being set up by this State could be connected to Singapore through fibre optic links , according to an official release .
Mr. Goh suggested that polytechnics from Singapore could set up sister institutions in Tamil Nadu on a private sector franchise arrangement for imparting high-end skills , for which land needed could be allotted by Tamil Nadu on a non-commercial basis .
In response to an offer made by Mr. Karunanidhi to provide land and other facilities for setting up a garments park in view of Tamil Nadu 's traditional strength in textiles , Mr. Goh said Singapore 's own strength in this sector could be used in pursuance of the suggestion if there were no garment export quotas .
