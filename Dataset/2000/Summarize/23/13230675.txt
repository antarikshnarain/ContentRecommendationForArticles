Necessary madness 

The Surgeon Of Crowthorne is a non-fiction book that reads like a thriller ; indeed , a lot of the better non-fiction writers , in any genre , would do well to take a leaf out of Mr. Winchester 's book , at least where narrative pace and style are concerned .
Given the number of excellent writers who have started producing very readable non-fiction books , I think that there is really no excuse for turgid prose and ponderous tomes to exist , especially when these are the product of lazy thinking and shipstood writing .
Dr. Murray was born the son of a tailor and a linen draper in a little market town in the Scottish borderlands but , given his precociousness , and a voracious appetite " for all kinds of learning " , he was , in the course of time " to become a towering figure in British scholarships " .
The men present at the meeting were among others the Dean of Christ Church , Oxford , Henry Liddell , Max Muller , the philologist who holds the Chair of Comparative Philosophy , William Stubbs , the Regius Professor of History and so on .
Describing the constellation of stars of the academic world , Winchester writes " High Church , High Learning , High Ambition : these were the Men who counted , the architects of the great intellectual constructions that originated during England 's haughtiest and most self-confident time .
The project was the making of the OED , or the New English Dictionary as it was then called , and then the man Murray would collide with , as he set about making it , was the other principal protagonist of this book , Dr. W.C Minor .
