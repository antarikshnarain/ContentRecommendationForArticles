SC upholds Madras HC ruling on election petition

Mr. Justice D. P. Wadhwa delivering the judgment of the Bench said that ` ` it will be thus seen that the election petition not only lacked the material facts , it lacked material particulars , defective verification and the affidavit filed was not in the form prescribed .
` ` A petition levelling a charge of corrupt practice is required by law to be supported by an affidavit and the election petitioner is obliged to disclose his source of information in respect of the commission of corrupt practice' ' and ` ` he must state which of the allegations are true to his knowledge and which to his belief on information received and believed by him to be true .
To plead corrupt practice as contemplated by law it had to be specifically alleged that the corrupt practices were committed with the consent of the candidate and that a particular electoral right of a person was affected , the Bench said and added that ` ` it can not be left to time , chance or conjecture for the court to draw inference by adopting an involved process or reasoning .
' ' ` ` Where several paragraphs of the election petition alleging corrupt practices remain unaffirmed under the verification clause as well as the affidavit , the unsworn allegation could have no legal existence and the Court could not take cognisance thereof,' ' the Bench noted .
