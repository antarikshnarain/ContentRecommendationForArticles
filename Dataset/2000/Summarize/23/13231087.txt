Yeoman service 

" OOCHAK - Oochak " - the sound reverberates in the ears ; the time is 6 a.m. ; I see a huge 10-foot tusker being drawn slowly by the cavady into the Moyar stream for a morning bath - other elephants follow , each guided by a cavady .
Their job starts in the morning when they take the animals for a bath , and bring them back to the camp for a ration of medicinal food ; thereafter the animals are let loose for grazing at will .
The Makhna ( tuskless male ) , a declared rogue and a killer , was captured , using tranquillizers , from the forests adjacent to Mudumalai in July 1998 in a daring operation by the Tamil Nadu Forest personnel .
This Makhna frequently raided paddy , ragi and jackfruit plantations in and around the forests of Kerala and Tamil Nadu and more recently the adjoining villages of Gudalur Taluk , terrorising the people .
The working diet for the elephants consists of horse gram , ragi flour , jaggery , coconut and salt ; to this is added mineral mix and ginger powder ( for better digestion ) and given in suitable proportions according to the age , weight and condition of the animal .
The elephants are used for various purposes : conservation , construction of bridges , clearing fallen trees across roads , clearing weeds in crucial habitat zones , chasing away rogue elephants , eco-tourism , protection against raids and for research purposes .
