American sanskriti 

Following up on the Maharaja 's very popular presentation , Milo Beach , the Curator of the Sackler and Freer Galleries who organised the Festival of India , is leading a Smithsonian study tour to Jodhpur and Rajasthan this month .
My own summer 1999 lecture series " Hinduism : Living Faith in America " at the Smithsonian 's College on the Mall was clearly another follow-up response to the interest in India stimulated by the Puja and Devi exhibitions and by the Maharaja 's Rajasthan series .
The Festival of India , the nation-wide fiftieth anniversary celebrations of Indian Independence , the Smithsonian 's many exhibitions , Indian writers and celebrities like the Maharaja of Jodhpur and others have all helped to broaden the spectrum of American appreciation for Indian culture .
Will the thing go too far , we ask ourselves balancing there precariously on the edge of the sofa , bug-eyes riveted to the tube , washing down cheekfuls of popcorn and veggie samosas with coke or trendy microbrew in rapt anticipation of the " kill " .
One memorable episode of the popular but now discontinued TV comedy series " Seinfeld " featured an Indian wedding shot in India satirising Americanised Indians who can not quite break away from strong family ethnic traditions .
It is Saturday evening and the last scherzo of dint gat in tintal of Vilayat Khan 's Raga Shree CD ( jacket signed of course ) has faded away in a rhythmic flourish and my family and guests are off to another pukka American dinner party at the Indian Palace .
