Lasers in the theatre 

The ND : YAG laser ( Neodymium , Ytrium - Aluminium Garnet ) is probably the most useful and versatile laser in the fields of general surgery and gastroenterology because of its ability to coagulate ( clot ) bleeding points .
For application inside the gastro-intestinal tract , laser beams are delivered through the endoscopic channel , to attack , for example , bleeding lesions three or four feet away from the body surface , within the colon ( large gut ) or stomach .
Clinical applications of lasers : There are two areas of gastroenterology where lasers are extremely useful : ( a ) Gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding : Bleeding from the GI tract is classified into upper GI bleeding , i.e .
( b ) : GI cancers : Another area where lasers have shown good results are in GI tract cancers - both in the upper and lower GI tract .
Using the laser fibre through the endoscope , these extra growths of the tumour are burnt out thus creating a clear pathway for the food ( if the cancer is in the food pipes or oesophagus ) or stool ( if the tumour had obstructed the lower most part of the gut or rectum ) .
In the upper GI tract , obstructing tumours of the stomach and oesophagus are the most common problems to be dealt with in this way , and in the lower GI tract , in obstructing tumours of the rectum and colon .
