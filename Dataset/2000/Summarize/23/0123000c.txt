Kargil war heroes honoured

Beaming at the attention , Paramvir Chakra Awardee , Grenadier Yogendra Singh Yadav and his company Commander , Mahavir Chakra Awardee , Captain Balwan Singh , who played a key role in capturing Tiger Hill in Drass subsector of Kargil in early July , are humility-personified .
So is Rifleman , Mr. Sanjay Kumar of 13 Jammu and Kashmir ( JAK ) Rifles , the other PVC Awardee who came back alive from the Kargil war after a brilliant operation on point 4875 .
The three soldiers , as also Major Sonam Wangchuk ( MVC ) of Ladakh Scouts and the parents of late Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey ( PVC ) of 1/11 Gorkha Rifles were present at a press briefing on the Army contingent at the Republic Day parade this year .
Losing their son , a promising sportsman and upcoming officer but above all a ` ` wonderful human being,' ' would be quite difficult for the Pandeys , but they are happy that both the Army and the Government have taken very good care of them .
Captain Balwan , a ` kid ' who had barely seen three months of service when he fought in Kargil , wants to ` ` wait for sometime' ' before he ties the knot .
But for the moment , their attention is on the parade , during which the President will pin the medals on the two PVC awardees and present the medals of their sons to parents of Captains Manoj Kumar Pandey and Vikram Batra of 13 JAK .
