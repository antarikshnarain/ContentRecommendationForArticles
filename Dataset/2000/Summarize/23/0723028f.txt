Sydney spectacular 

I walked in through the Clarrie Grimmett Gates , across the ground where my hero Vijay Hazare had scored 100 in each innings 40 years previously , and out through the Victor Richardson Gates .
Surely we must include Charlie Macartney , the " Governor General " , whose character is revealed in the compliment he once paid the great S . F. Barnes ( " How good is Barnes ?
Where then does that leave Stan McCabe , who played three of the greatest attacking innings in Test history ( at Brisbane in 1932-33 , at Johannesburg in 1935-36 , and at Trent Bridge in 1938 - of the last his captain , Bradman , remarked , " If I could bat like that I would be a proud man , Stan " ) ?
The list might go on , and on - Michael Slater , Mark Waugh , Norman O'Neill , Syd Barnes , Syd Gregory.. . After two most contentious places , number six can be uncontroversially allotted to Keith Ross Miller , originally of Melbourne , but who came to play for and captain New South Wales .
These were Arthur Mailey , millionaire of spin , W. J. O'Reilly , known with reason as the " Tiger " , and Richie Benaud , who , though not as destructive as the other two , was a vastly better batsman and fielder .
I shall seek forgiveness by offering an alternate , New South Wales eleven , an eleven that might as swiftly annihilate the best of Victoria or Queensland or Western Australia .
