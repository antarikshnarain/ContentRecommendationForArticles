TV for the Valley 

For some time now there has been a separate terrestrial channel for Kashmir called " Kashir " , featuring two hours of the kind of stuff Doordarshan will put out if you tell them to win hearts .
Those who tune in in the valley will be able to see " Tara " , " Hum Panch " , " Khana Khazana " , " Thoda Hai Thoda Ki Zaroorat Hai " , " Uncensored " , " Shanti " and much else .
But the behaviour of the man called Narender who showered Ilyasi with gifts , threatened to take his life if they were refused , and was persistent in demanding Ilyasi 's attention falls into the category of obsessive compulsive behaviour which TV personalities sometimes encounter in their fans .
He would stride on , harangue his viewers , run a recreation of the crime not with the finesse that " Bhanwar " on Sony does , but crudely , with a lot of blood and gore , and then enjoin those watching to help nab the criminals who were still at large : " Together we can and will make a difference !
Another woman managed to find her way into almost every studio audience for " Aap Ki Adalat " , wrote regularly to him of her obsession , kept track of his phone numbers and changes of secretaries , and got into and out of a marriage through her period of infatuation with him .
There was poignant contrast between the haranguing persona of the central figure in " India 's Most Wanted " and the crumpled face of the stricken young man whom television news cameras were seeking out for reasons other than his show .
