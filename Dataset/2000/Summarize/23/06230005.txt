ITC to put up hotel in Calcutta 

The construction of ITC 's first hotel project - ITC Sonar Bangla - was formally flagged off in the city by the Chief Minister of West Bengal , Mr. Jyoti Basu .
The hotel is being designed to cater to up-market global travellers in the eastern region , national and international delegates participating at conventions in the city , as well as delegates and visitors to the Science City .
