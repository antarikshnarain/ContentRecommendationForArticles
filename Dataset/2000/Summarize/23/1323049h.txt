A temple regains its glory 

THE 196 foot tall tower of the Andal - Rangamannar - Vatapatrasayee temple at Srivilliputtur , which the Tamil Nadu Government has adopted as its emblem and the twin temple complex have at last been renovated at last at a cost of Rs .
The house where Periyazhwar and Andal lived became the nucleus for the new temple constructed over 600 years ago while the Vatapatrasayee temple , was built over 1,200 years ago .
But the lethargic government machinery took another decade to wake up to the issue and the renovation work was " reinaugurated " by Mr. R. M. Veerappan , who was the Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister , on November 10 , 1981 , according to a plaque found on the western side of the tower .
The renovation of the vimanams over the shrines of Vatapatrasayee , Periazhwar , Narasimhar , Ramanuja and Nammazhwar , the Thiruppavai Vimanam in the Andal temple , laying of tiles on the ceilings of both temples , repairing of Dwajasthambams and Palipeetams and other works were also taken up .
Andal had a special longing for the Lords of Tirumala ( Tirupati ) and Alagarkoil near Madurai , as expressed in her poems and both the Lords wear the garlands used by Andal , on particular days - the former on the Garudotsavam day in the month of Purattasi and the latter on the Chithra Pournami day , at Madurai .
There are many wooden carvings in both temples and the Gopalavilasam hall in the Vatapatrasayee temple is excellent in its conception and these as well as the frescoes on the ceiling at the entrance of the Andal temple , and huge granite sculptures in its pillars , numbering over a dozen , remain as permanent evidences to our rich cultural heritage .
