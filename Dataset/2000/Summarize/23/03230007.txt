G-7 meet: Ministers issue alert against graft 

Besides money laundering and harmful tax competition , ` ` the benefits and opportunities of the international financial system can also be undermined by corruption,' ' a G-7 communique said .
` ` We support the work being done in various fora on anti- corruption measures,' ' said the statement issued after a one-day meeting of the G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors .
Immediately after the meeting , the U.S. Treasury Secretary , Mr . Lawrence Summers , rammed home the point , demanding Japan open its markets to ensure faster growth critical to the world .
` ` What is most important for Japan and what is most important for the global economy is that sustained domestic demand-led growth be achieved in Japan,' ' Mr. Summers said .
Japan won a G-7 endorsement for its fears that a strong yen would eat away at the value of its exports , one of the few strong pillars of its fragile recovery .
The G-7 statement stressed the need to ` ` take advantage of the investment opportunities created by new technologies,' ' echoing U.S. frustration at Japan 's failure to push along the Internet bandwagon with lower telephone costs .
