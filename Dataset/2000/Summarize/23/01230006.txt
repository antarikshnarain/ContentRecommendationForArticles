Cong.(I) releases first list of candidates

In keeping with Mrs. Sonia Gandhi 's wish to give a new profile to the party , by fielding fresh faces and younger candidates , little over 23 per cent of the nominees are under 40 years of age .
Prominent among the nominees are the Congress ( I ) Legislature Party leader , Mr. Ramashray Prasad Singh , former PCC ( I ) president Dr. Sarfaraz Ahmed , two of the recently appointed BPCC ( I ) working presidents , Mr. Furkan Ansari and Prof. Ram Jatan Sinha , and the former president of the Jharkhand Regional Congress ( I ) Committee , Mrs. Sushila Kerketta .
Despite Mrs. Gandhi 's reported interest in fielding a greater number of women candidates , only six women figure in the list - a mere 5.6 per cent of the total .
Mr. Devipada Upadhyay ( formerly of the CPI ) and Mr. Hari Ram Sardar ( formerly of the JMM-S ) , who joined the Congress ( I ) five days ago , have been given tickets .
