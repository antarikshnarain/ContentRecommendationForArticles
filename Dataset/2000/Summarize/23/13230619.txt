Promises and perils 

In Britain , the debate over whether GM crops should be grown commercially before the end of a four-year period of research into their environmental effects took a violent turn as Greenpeace activists descended on trial fields and ripped up the maize planted there .
The fear that contamination of other crops and plants through cross-pollination from GM crops is " inevitable and irreversible , " to quote Helen Wallace , scientist with Greenpeace , cuts no ice with biotechnologists .
Granted that GM crops are risky , " new varieties of conventional crops are riskier , " Beringer argues , because " conventional breeders cross crops with distant relatives to produce new hybrids containing thousands of new genes " and " we know almost nothing about them .
We can not blind ourselves to the fact that 50 years of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in agriculture while increasing crop yields has also made farming look like " a 19th century smokestack industry " , as Jim Orson , director of the Morley Research Station in Norfolk , ruefully admits .
Intensive farming pollutes water and depletes non-renewable resources such as soil ; organic farming can not boost crop yields to the levels needed to feed earth 's burgeoning population .
The fear of biotechnology can also be allayed if scientists could engage in sensible dialogue with the public and show that the processes and products of gene technology have been properly screened to take into account environmental safety as well as consumer benefit .
