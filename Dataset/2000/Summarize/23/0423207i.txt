All parties face problems 

According to highly-placed sources , in case this dispute is not resolved immediately , the alliance could well be a thing of the past as the Chief Minister , Mr. Om Prakash Chautala , who is also the INLD supremo , is determined not to concede even an inch to the BJP on this issue .
Interestingly , though it is being mentioned in political circles that the row between the two parties would be resolved amicably with the intervention of the Punjab Chief Minister , Mr. Prakash Singh Badal , knowledgeable sources assert that the situation has gone beyond intervention .
According to sources , Mr. Chautala has so far been dealing patiently with the BJP hoping that the issue would be resolved amicably and the two parties would repeat the grand performance during the recently held Lok Sabha polls when the entire opposition was wiped out .
Observers also feel that if the INLD and the BJP were to part company , Mr. Chautala could field a few Ministers , who had won the last Assembly polls as Independents , as INLD candidates from Panipat , Hissar , Indri , Ambala Cantt. , Chachrauli and Narnaul to cite some examples .
Interestingly , there is resentment among the INLD grassroots workers against the BJP for its anti-INLD stance which became evident after the Union Home Minister , Mr. L. K. Advani , exhorted the BJP in Haryana at a party conclave in Rohtak recently to carve a niche of its own in State politics .
As for the Congress , the claims of ` ` unity' ' have proved to be a ` ` hype' ' so far as tickets distribution is concerned as all factions have staked their claims for almost all the 90 seats making it tough for the party high command to finalise the list .
