Between change and futurism 

Real and lasting challenges to colonialism , casteism , racism , sexism and Marxism in the last century emerged , not from the steam locomotives , steel furnaces , penicillin or the Internet , but from our basic yearning for respect and self-rule .
Can we hope that in the coming years , satellite phones , Microsoft Windows , the Web and the Internet and medical techniques such as amniocentesis , organ and embryo transplants , will wash out all this debris ?
True , at the moment the Indian corporate scene is still divided between the old work-ethic and the new democratisation of the work place , but pressures of globalisation are fast removing age-old barriers to alternate work practices and in the humanisation of the market place .
The first wave of " Mandalised " elections may have thrown up backward leaders of dubious to despicable merits in the North ; but in the South , where the gestation period for the idea has been twice as long ; we are witnessing the simultaneous rise of leaders with potential , and a deepening and broadening of democracy among the masses .
As a result , even the world of women in the four Southern States , is now displaying positive signs like increased literacy , decreased infant and maternal mortality rates and greater and a better rate of participation in the institutions of democracy such as the gram panchayats .
Time and again , the major changes in history , we will do well to remember , have resulted not from bloody wars and boardroom coups , but from individuals sidestepping the world of the autocrats and placing their allegiance in higher democratic and spiritual values that satisfy the basic hunger for love , honour and justice .
