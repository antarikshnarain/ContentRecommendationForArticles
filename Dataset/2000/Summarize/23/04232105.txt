CLP to execute project with Indian partner 

The China Light Power Company ( CLP ) today informed the Karnataka Government its resolve to execute the much-delayed 1000 MW thermal power project near Mangalore by involving an Indian partner .
Mr. Krishna , emerging from the meeting , said the CLP and the MPC had communicated that they would be executing the project with an Indian partner and had accepted the conditions set by the Government and also the Centre 's new guidelines .
Mr. Krishna said he had explained to the CLP and the MPC representatives that because of shift in stance of the Centre , there was a change in the format in which the project had to be executed , and the PPA had to be reconsidered .
Mr. Krishna said the authorities of the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation ( KPTCL ) and representatives of the CLP and the MPC would be holding consultations with the expert committee headed by Mr. Deepak Parekh , set up by the State Government to study the project , at its meeting scheduled on January 28 .
The CLP and the MPC presented a note on the project to the Chief Minister during the discussion , in which it said it would operationalise a ` ` world class' ' coal plant , which would be more thermally-efficient and produce cheaper electricity than a gas- based plant , as the State was toying with idea of encouraging LNG-based power plant .
