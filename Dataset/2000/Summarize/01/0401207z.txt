Case filed against Haryana DGP

The case was registered after a fortnight of the Supreme Court 's order upholding the Punjab and Haryana High Court directions to the State police to register a case against Mr. Rathore for molestation which would be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) .
On the basis of the report prepared by then DGP , Mr. R. R. Singh in which a prima facie case was established against Mr. Rathore , the case was pursued by Mrs. Madhu Parkash and her husband Anand Parkash whose daughter was a friend of the girl .
In 1997 Mrs. Madhu Parkash managed to get hold of the report and moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court which ordered that an FIR should be filed against Mr. Rathore and the case should be investigated by the CBI .
Mr. Rathore went to the Supreme Court against the High Court 's order and questioned the locus standi of Mrs. Madhu Parkash in the case .
