Evolve policy to combat lead poisoning, Centre urged

A recent study conducted by the Foundation in the seven major cities of Bangalore , Chennai , Hyderabad , Vellore , Mumbai , Delhi and Calcutta , disclosed that over 50 per cent of children below the age of 12 had elevated levels of lead in their bloodstream , well above the permissible limit of 10 meg/de .
A paper brought out by the foundation urged the Government to usher in urgent changes to long-standing industrial practises , including introduction of unleaded petrol all over the country and screening of drinking water , milk , food and other consumer articles for lead contamination .
It was reported that the production of lead storage batteries in the country was around eight million and the estimated release of lead per 1,000 batteries was 11.35 kg .
It was reported that small-scale foundries , secondary lead smelters and storage of lead batteries were a source of high blood lead levels among urban slum children in cities such as Mumbai .
According to experts , the practise of re-coating the inner surface of brass utensils with a mixture of lead and tin ( tinning ) , mostly in the southern states , was a major source of lead poisoning as the alloy had 55 to 70 per cent of lead .
In Bangalore , lead contamination was mostly from lead water pipes , food containers and from inhaling exhaust fumes of automobiles using leaded petrol .
