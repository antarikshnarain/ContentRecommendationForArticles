They were key players in reviving militancy

The three hardcore militants , two Pakistanis and a Kashmiri , who were exchanged today to secure the safe release of 154 hostages in the hijacked Indian Airlines plane , were key players in renewing the militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and were also behind several cases of kidnappings of foreigners .
While Mohammad Masood Azhar alias Vali Adam Issa was lodged at Kot Balwal Jail near Jammu and Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheikh was kept in Tihar Jail , the Kashmiri militant , Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar was held at Srinagar .
Ahmed Umar Sheikh was whisked away from Tihar jail under tight security around 1 p.m .
He went to Nairobi in December 1993 to enlist support for HKUM 's demand , asking Pakistan to withdraw its forces from Somalia , where its troops were a part of the U.N. forces and were acting as a ` shield for U.S. army ' from attacks by ` Islamic Forces' .
Azhar came to Delhi in January , 1994 via Dhaka on a forged Portugese passport , to supervise the merger of the two militant outfits - Harkat-Ul- Mujahideen and Harkat-e-Jihad-e-Islami ( HUJI ) , under a new name of Harkat-ul-Ansar .
His brief was to abduct foreigners , to secure the release of Mohammad Azhar and other Harkat leaders lodged in the Indian jails .
