Nimble numbers

At the Headstart School run by Vidyothasahi Educational and Charitable Trust and located in Kottivakkam on the outskirts of Chennai , Mr . and Mrs. Mahesh who run the school are determined to provide the very young with this edge .
A visit to the maths exhibition put up by the students from pre- Kg to Class I showed how learning has been linked with play , which is an integral part of childhood .
This trains the child to look at all matters of learning from various angles and the child is encouraged to develop a sense of lateral thinking .
The Mathematics for LKG included quantitative meaning of numbers , finding missing numbers , finding numbers that come before and after 1 to 10 .
Nazreen , mother of Zajid , tow plus , says her son enjoy learning in this way and goes to school happily .
Mrs. Sudha Mahesh , author of the textbooks " Fun with Maths " Levels I and II , insists that only during the second term at LKG level , they make the children write 1 to 10 .
