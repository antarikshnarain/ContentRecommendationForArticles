The world of camel and llama

A sure-footed animal , it is smaller than the llama , has longer , softer wool and is not usually used as a beast of burden .
Vicuna , ( 40 Ptas ) , is native to the Andes in Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia and is a close relative of the domesticated llama .
The llama stands 0.9 to 1.3m high at the shoulder and is usually white , with black and brown blotches ; sometimes it is pure white or pure black .
Arabian camel , ( 105 Ptas ) , is a large ruminant native to the desert regions of Asia and northern Africa .
There are two kinds of camels : the dromedary or Arabian camel , which has one hump ; and the Bactrian camel , which has two humps .
The Arabian camel is adapted to subsistence in the desert by its structural qualities and by its ability to bite off and consume the thorny plants that grow there .
