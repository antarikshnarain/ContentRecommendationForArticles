Curfew fails to quell riots in Ambon

The latest estimate in Jakarta about the death toll in the Halmahera sector of the northern Maluku region was around 265 , while nearly 70 others had died in communal violence in the Ambon region , in the past four or five days - in all , a total of under 350 ( not 400 in three days of violence in Halmahera alone , contrary to non-official stories ) .
U.N. apology on E.Timor Even as the U.N. appointed a Filipino military officer , Maj. Gen . Jaime de Los Santos , as the Force Commander under the auspices of the United Nations ' Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) , apologies were conveyed to the people of that territory on behalf of the world organisation .
The plea for forgiveness was made in the context of the perceived failure of the United Nations ' Assistance Mission in East Timor ( UNAMET ) , which conducted a ` ` popular consultation' ' on Aug. 30 on the territory 's future , to anticipate and prevent the outbreak of a carnage in the wake of a nearly 80-per-cent vote in that referendum in favour of that enclave 's separation from Indonesia .
