Signature campaign to release Kolappan panel report 

Agricultural workers under the banner of the CPI in Tamil Nadu have launched a state-wide signature campaign to press the Government to make public the Kolappan Committee report , which went into a host of welfare measures for the farm labourers .
The panel had made nearly 60 recommendations including pension for agriculture labour , but the Government has only confined itself to announcing the revised minimum wages for farm labour , Mr.R.Mutharasan , general secretary of the CPI-affiliated Tamil Nadu Agriculture Workers Union , said .
The CPI Students wing state secretary , Mr.D.Lenin , has said in a statement that they will organise a pledge-taking throughout the State tomorrow ` ` with candle in hand' ' to proclaim the students ' ` ` right to education' ' and to press the Government to ensure the same at the beginning of the new millennium itself .
