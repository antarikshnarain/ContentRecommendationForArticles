A calculated move to help Putin 

Mr. Putin , a 46-year-old former KGB officer appointed Prime Minister only in August , is today Russia 's most popular politician , largely thanks to his resolute handling of the war in Chechnya .
The Itar-Tass news agency said Mr. Yeltsin still planned to visit the Holy Land in Palestine next week to mark the first Orthodox Christmas of the new millennium despite stepping down as Russia 's President .
Reuters reports : After announcing his resignation today , Mr. Boris Yeltsin must hand over to his acting successor one of the most important symbols of power in Russia : the briefcase with codes to launch nuclear missiles .
` ` The nuclear button is an effective mechanism to control Russian nuclear forces and also a symbol of the presidency,' ' the former Yeltsin Press Secretary , Mr. Sergei Yastrzhembsky said when asked to describe the device .
A senior Parliament member , Mr. Alexei Arbatov , has described the nuclear button as the first link in a chain of commands ending in onboard cruise computers of nuclear missiles .
` ` The nuclear button...transmits Presidential sanction for the use of nuclear weapons to command centres where general staff officers are on duty around the clock,' ' said Mr . Arbatov , an expert on national security with close ties to the Kremlin .
