'Rupee may remain stable in Y2K' 

` ` I think the rupee had the potential to appreciate but for the RBI 's policy of not letting it appreciate beyond certain levels,' ' said Ms. Sangya Nigam , analyst at Mecklai Financial .
' ' As India has seen many political upheavals in 1999 , even if one more happens the rupee has learned the lessons and will be much more stable this time , Ms. Sangya added. ` ` The Indian rupee will do an encore of 1999 against the dollar in 2000,' ' said Mr. Vasan Shridharan , Economist of Standard Chartered Bank .
In 1998 , the BSE Sensex started at 3659 and ended at 3055 , down by 17.3 per cent and in 1999 it started at 3060 and ended at 5005 , an appreciation of around 54 per cent .
Unlike 1998 , when premiums were as high as 15 to 22 per cent , the premiums have been steadily coming down since the beginning of this year ; In January 1999 , the six month annualised premium was around 10 to 11 per cent and now at the year end the premiums are at around 4 per cent .
Moreover , at the beginning of 1999 , the indications given by the Finance Minister , Mr. Yeshwant Sinha , and the RBI Governor , Dr . Bimal Jalan , were towards lower interest rates and it started right after the budget when the repo rate was reduced from 8 per cent to 6 per cent , the Bank Rate from 9 to 8 per cent , and cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) from 10.5 to 9 per cent .
Against 8 per cent in December 1998 the 12-month forward premium now is around 4 to 4.5 per cent , six month premium is at 4 per cent against 7.5 per cent last year and 3- months is around 3.5 per cent against 6 per cent earlier .
