The heartbreaks of the millennium 

MANY WILL remember Finland 's Juha Miato crying bitter tears of disappointment in the woods of Lake Placid in 1980 after he lost the 15-kilometres cross-country skiing Olympic gold to Thomas Wassbarg by one hundredth of a second .
A Swede also figured prominently eight years earlier at the Munich Games , when Gunnar Larsson won the 400m medley swim gold with an advantage of two thousands of a second over American Alexander Mckee .
Ottey lost the 100m gold at the 1993 world championships and 1996 Olympics to American Gail Devers after a review of the photo finish after both posted identical times .
Ehrl won all his fights and only got the silver because Italy 's Giovanni Gozzi , whom Ehrl also beat , took the gold because he had amassed more points in his fights .
Sweden 's modern Pentathlon compatriots were not so lucky in 1968 Mexico Games because they lost the team bronze medal after Hans- Gunnar Liljenwall was caught with a too high blood alcohol level after the shooting competition .
And finally there were three American sprinters Eddie Hart , Ray Robinson and Robert Taylor sitting in the Olympic village in 1972 in Munich watching the daily live broadcast , when suddenly the 100m quarterfinals were listed where Hart was to start in the first race .
