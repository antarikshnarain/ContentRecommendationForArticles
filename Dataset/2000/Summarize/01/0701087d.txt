Ministerian reveals his Classic intentions 

Minutes after Ministerian pounced on a well merited field like a hungry tiger on a bunch of unsuspecting deer , the thoughts had quickly turned to the Republic Day Winter Derby as the Foyer-Ministrella gelding 's prime target .
Twice shown his place by Crystal Man and Baffin Bay in two successive big race attempts , there was understandable sense of dismay that this talented gelding is not living up to the promise of his bloodline .
Unable to make an iota of an impact on the widening margin , Sea Classic served his own cause well by finishing ahead of a group of well-heeled class oners , kind of a rebuff that his last start win was no flash in the pan and he is a much better horse than he is given credit for .
Incidentally , former jockey Karan Singh a member of the 1,000 winners elite but now a successful trainer must have been half expecting the BTC to seek the trophy that was given to him when he piloted his 1,000th winner .
Whether the saddle assitance by J D Smith was adequate or not is hard to say but a casual eye could easily pick up a long way from home that Haynes Park , having lost a forward position , had put herself at a premium to do anything better than what she ended up doing .
Paul Eddery came back with a sorry tale on Regal Wind who ran into more than one traffic snarl to eventually finish full of running behind Joint Command , who no doubt had the requisite merit to carry the day having spent his time earlier with better class horses .
