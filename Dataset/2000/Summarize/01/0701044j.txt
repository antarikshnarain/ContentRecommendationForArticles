The icons who ruled the century 

Quite undoubtedly if it was that legendary Brazilian , Edson Arantes do Nascimento or popularly known as Pele who held the attention of millions of fans all around the globe in the sixties and early seventies then it was Diego Maradona who brought back that sublime touch of a genius to virtually singlehandedly lift Argentina to World Cup champion status in 1986 .
Didi , Garrincha , Vava , Zagalo and Zito were some of the names making waves in international football when Pele stepped in to churn Brazilian football into a kind of sorcery .
Pele had come at a time when Brazilian goal getters used to be Garrincha , the ` little bird ' , Didi , the man famous for his ` falling leaf ' free kicks ( known in later years as banana kicks ) , Vava and Zagalo .
Even in his last World Cup in 1970 , which again went to Brazil for the third time to enable the country to keep the Jules Rimet trophy permanently , Pele 's touch was unmistakable as he rose above the defence to fire an unstoppable header .
What also remained unforgettable about Pele among his admirers was the man 's humility , his demeanour on the field and his undying devotion for his parents , who ironically did not wish that he should be a footballer and coach Waldemer de Brito , who unravelled the ` black pearl' .
For a man , who in recent times showed the humility to state that he still thought Di Stefano was better than him , after he was given the exalted status of ` Argentina 's sportsperson of the century ' , it is an irony that his life off football had to be such a mess .
