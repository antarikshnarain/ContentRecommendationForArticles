Opposition may turn the heat on Govt. 

Only two of the Opposition leaders - Dr. Manmohan Singh of the Congress ( I ) and Mr. Kanshi Ram of the Bahujan Samaj Party - attended the meeting convened at short notice .
Emerging from the meeting , the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and senior Congress ( I ) leader , Dr. Manmohan Singh , said ` ` we are naturally relieved and happy that the passengers have been released , but the nation would have to ponder over the consequences of terrorism'' .
The Congress ( I ) president , Mrs. Sonia Gandhi , was originally scheduled to attend the meeting , but decided against it when it was realised that the other parties would not be present .
Earlier , the Congress ( I ) expressed consternation at the Government 's decision to free three top-ranking terrorists and warned that the step would have serious and far-reaching implications .
Speaking on behalf of the party , Mr. Pranab Mukherjee feared that the entire law-enforcing machinery in Kashmir would be rendered ` ` a lame duck' ' at a time when Pakistan was carrying on a proxy war against India .
Mr. Mukherjee expressed happiness at the release of the hostages , but added that it was ` ` still inexplicable' ' why the Government had failed to act when the hijacked plane was in Amritsar .
