Racing against the sun

But if , following this advice , you look beyond the cover , you will notice that the message is really that judging a book by its cover is exactly what most people do : so you better make sure that you are well covered , at all times .
Even the plodders who are not plodding simply to give themselves an excuse to escape into themselves , even plodders who have a definite goal in mind , spend far too much of their time constructing airplanes just for the purpose of crossing the road .
The smarter ones ( and , believe me , a surprising number of plodders are , in fact , quite smart ) plod not because they do n't know how to move faster ; but because they have realised that , in the long run , they can not rely on just their wits .
In this connection , I do n't know if you have noticed the way that , though the sun moves so very slowly that it scarcely seems to be moving at all , it is simply impossible for you to overtake it , no matter how hard you race .
Either they are the grumpy , grouchy sort ; always at you for watching too much TV ( specially when they want you to move over because they themselves want to watch ) , always at you to do something with your life , make something of yourself , or going on and on about " how easy kids have it these days , how hard it was for us when we were kids .
A few quick points , if you are the sort who can " keep your head while all about you are losing theirs , " then I will leave you to journey on your own into the new century ; your century .
