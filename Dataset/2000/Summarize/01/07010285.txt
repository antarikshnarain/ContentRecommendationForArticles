One-month ban for Akhtar 

The wounds of defeat in the World Cup final and the 3- 0 drubbing in Test series against Australia were not yet completely healed that a news on New Millennium eve came that Shoaib could not compete in international cricket until he changes his bowling action .
Headed by Lieutenant General Tauqir Zia , the Cricket Board was criticised by some quarters when it decided to send the 24-year-old ` Rawalpindi Express ' to Australia despite a pending inquiry at ICC 's Panel of Illegal Deliveries against the fast bowler .
What 's the fun now , he ( Shoaib ) will be back home , said a fuming former Test cricketer on condition of anonymity , who had advocated the idea that Shoaib should be held back until the ICC gives its ruling .
The then chairman Dr. Zafar Altaf did not admit that the ICC had sent a letter of complaint along with video footage of Shoaib 's action to the PCB .
Being himself a fast bowler , Imran could have pleaded Shoaib 's case much better that a spinner ( Intikhab Alam ) ,' ' said another former Test player .
Reuter adds : Waqar to replace Akhtar Waqar Younis was today named to replace suspended fellow Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar , who is to return home from the team 's tour of Australia after his action was ruled illegal .
