Sales tax on 37 items hiked 

The Government has announced a new tax regime involving increase in the sales tax on 37 commodities to bring them on a par with the uniform floor rates throughout the country .
The Chief Minister , Mr. N. Chandrababu Naidu , who briefed the press later , explained that it was also proposed to abolish VAT ( value added tax ) from April 1 , 2001 .
The six rates are 0 per cent , 4 per cent , 8 per cent , 12 per cent and special percentage of 1 and 20 in respect of items like bullion and narcotics .
Even while implementing the new floor rates , the Government would 'fight it out ' for adopting the zero floor rate for processed salt , sprinkler systems , farm implements and pasteurised milk and lower floor rate of 4 per cent for tractors , power tillers , plastic goods , computers and electronics , Mr. Chandrababu Naidu explained .
Mr. Naidu also said pasteurised milk was one of the 36 items identified for increase of ST to bring them on a par with the new basic rate , but they would urge the Central Government to reconsider the floor rate for pasteurised milk in the light of decisions by various courts which held that pasteurised milk and fresh milk were one and the same .
The following are the items on which sales tax is being increased : Bullion ( present rate 0.50 and new rate 1.00 ) , edible oils ( from 2 per cent to 4 per cent ) , oilseeds ( 2 to 4 ) , bicycle ( 2 to 4 ) , chemical fertilizers ( 3 to 4 ) , agricultural implements ( zero to 4 ) , maize products , starch ( 2 to 4 ) , electronic goods , computers ( 3.5 to 8 ) , TV , VCR and electronic toys ( 3.50 to 12 ) , dry fruit ( 10 to 12 ) , photographic film ( 4 to 8 ) , motor vehicles except tractors ( 8 to 12 ) , musical instruments ( 10 to 12 ) , plastic goods and PVC articles ( 10 to 12 ) , soaps ( 10 to 12 ) , poultry feed ( 0 to 4 ) , branded processed salt ( 0 to 4 ) , silk and silk fabrics ( 8 to 12 ) .
