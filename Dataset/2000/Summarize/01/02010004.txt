Minister had named the same three militants

Quoting an unidentified caller at the Air Traffic Controller in Delhi , the Minister had announced on the morning of the second day of the hijack drama that the hijackers had demanded the release of the Pakistani cleric , Maulana Masood Azhar , the U.K.- based Pakistani national , Mustaq Ahmad Zargar and a third militant whose ` ` name was not audible'' .
The Minister was quoted extensively by the television networks and the news agencies throughout the day till a visibly annoyed Foreign Minister , Mr. Jaswant Singh , stated that ` ` it is not wise to respond to anonymous calls which can not be traced and which have no lineage'' .
