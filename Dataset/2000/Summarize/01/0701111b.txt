The greatest in one hundred years 

' ' But Ali was more - so much , much more - than simply the greatest boxer of his or any other century ; liberal politicians , folk singers and religious leaders may have been the first to speak out against the Vietnam War , but it was only when Ali declared himself a conscientious objector that the youth of white , middle-class America used their draft- cards to build a mounting bonfire of protest .
' ' If you have never watched baseball or read the sport 's folkore , then my third-placed pick will appear incongruous , but it was Babe Ruth who single-handedly transformed the game into America 's national pastime .
With his piggy eyes , bulbous nose , flabby torso and sparrow 's legs , Ruth was an unlikely sporting hero , yet like Ali and Pele , his arrival at the batting plate sent a shiver of expectation through the attendant audience .
Judged soley by his tally of ` Majors ' , the Golden Bear is supreme , winning more titles than Hogan and Tom Watson put together , more than Player and Palmer put together , more than Jones and Sam Snead put together .
Positions 6-9 produced a blanket finish ; basketball 's Michael Jordan , the first globally admired superstar who happened to be black rather than a black superstar ; Jesse Owens , who made nonsense of Hitler 's sick sense of Aryan superiority ; Rod Laver , the finest tennis player who ever lived and the game 's most gracious champion ; Gary Sobers , cricket 's greatest all-rounder ( my thanks again to Messrs. Swanton and Cowdrey for introducing me to his genius ) .
And , lastly at No 10 , Tommie Smith , a highly personal man whose courage and humanity moved me to tears when I had the privilege of interviewing him in 1993 , on the 25th anniversary of the Black Power salute he delivered on the podium in Mexico City after winning the Olympic 200 metres gold medal .
