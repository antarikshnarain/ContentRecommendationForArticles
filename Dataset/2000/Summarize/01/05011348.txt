Taliban is the biggest gainer

In New Delhi , there was a tremendous sense of relief over the release of 159 passengers and crew members of the unlucky plane but , at the same time , there was the painful realisation that a political climb- down became inevitable to achieve the objective of undoubted considerable humanitarian significance .
Pakistan does not conceal its glee over New Delhi 's discomfiture but its propaganda machinery was engaged all these days in virulent attacks against India , obviously to counter the widespread perception of their involvement in this terrorist act and to deflect attention from it .
Initially , the hijackers planned to land at Kabul but that would not have yielded the desired dividends to the Taliban - for this city conjured up visions of obscurantism and bigotry as against Kandahar with its relaxed , moderate setting , which is more acceptable to the outside world .
Because of its conduct during the fighting for the control of Kabul and the rest of the country and afterwards , it came out as a medieval force , disdainful of modern ideas of tolerance , equity , of gender equality , putting the narrowest , even uncalled for interpretations on the tenets of Islam .
The Taliban authorities were recognised by only three countries - Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and UAE - while the rest of the world regarded the Rabbani Government as the lawful authority even though it controlled some 10 per cent of the territory .
Diplomats belonging to the countries , the nationals of which were among the hostages , went to Kandahar , the media teams from all over the world descended on the city , primarily for covering the hijack episode but , in the process , focussing on the Taliban leaders and their activities , as they put their best foot forward .
