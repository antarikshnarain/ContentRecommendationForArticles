dated January 1, 1950: Dr. Ida S. Scudder

Auspicious indeed was the First of January , 1900 , the first day of a new month of a new year of a new century , and that was the day that Heaven chose for Dr. Ida Scudder to begin her task of healing ministry in Vellore , for the men , women and children of South India .
Had Dr. Scudder chosen to be a legislator , in India or in her own country , she would rapidly have achieved success , for her judgment was accurate , her motives were pure , and she had an infallible instinct for picking out the right people for the right place .
She had always kept an open mind , and had never indulged in harshness , sarcasm or ridicule , but students and staff alike had known that her ` Yea ' is Yea and her ` Nay ' is Nay , for she had worked with them and for them - in partnership with God .
