Allaire justifies looks 

Though Allaire , the chestnut daughter of Razeen , bred at the Mehra Stud , was the cynosure , to support her chances against Victory March , Gironde and Anna Pavlova in the betting ring was beyond the reach of a common punter .
Allaire who was badly pocketed after passing the bend caused anxious moments , but Aslam without losing cool and using his skill sent her through the gap between Batalik ( P. Shroff up ) and Gironde ( M. Narredu astride ) to achieve the desired result .
` ` After watching Picasso 's last third in Pune and his track performances , Picasso seems to be a lazy type and he runs far better in front but fails to improve if ridden from behind and that was why , we removed blinkers and sent him from start to finish in this race .
When the Handicapper Mr. R. M. Seth was asked why a race was not framed for two year olds he said that ` ` For Thursday 's races , I framed the race thrice but only five horses were entered and according to the rule , we needed six runners .
Trainer H. J. Antia 's Premier League 's chances of wearing the winner 's crown , in the feature event , and that too in the hands of an apprentice jockey R. Shelar was a remote possibility because in his earlier run in the lower class carrying 58.5 kgs , he had ended last .
But Antia 's assessment of his ward in the enhanced class with light weight proved right when a 5 to 1 chance , Premier League collared Wolf River and Jaannisar in the straight to come up trumps by seven lengths .
