Lee making 'rapid strides' is not good news for Indians

The Brett Lee phenomenen is likely to break Australia 's short-lived two-spinner tradition at the Sydney Cricket Ground when the third and final Test against India begins on Sunday .
The joy of his rapid rise has put on hold , at least temporarily , the excitement surrounding Shane Warne needing only five wickets to overtake Dennis Lillee 's record 355 .
Lee has made such a huge impact during his Test debut in Melbourne this week that the state of the pitch is unlikely to be a serious consideration in the make-up of the team .
Even though off-spinner Colin Miller has been included in a squad of 13 , the closest he is expected to come to the centre of the SCG is carrying the drinks , with Michael Kasprowicz left out altogether .
After all , given India 's love of spinners and uncertainty against pace , who would the Aussies rather play against - a spinner who has hardly managed a first class match this season or the fastest bowler in the country after a seven- wicket debut which included breaking the thumb of opening batman Sadagopan Ramesh ?
` ` You can start bowling reverse swing from 20 to 25 overs at the SCG , where it takes up to 50 overs in other places,' ' Lee said .
