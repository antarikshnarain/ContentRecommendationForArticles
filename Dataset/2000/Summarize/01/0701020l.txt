A legend in his own right 

' Garry Kasparov , who has never been beaten by a human in a match and who is the best player in the world for the last 15 years , may be the strongest player of all time , but it was the temperamental American genius who made chess what it is today - a popular game the world over , with big money .
` ` I would never have become a chess player , but for the Fischer- Spassky world championship duel in 1972,' ' British Grandmaster and chess writer Tony Koston told this writer once .
From 1962 till the premature , and abrupt , end of his career in 1972 he won every tournament in which he played except the Capablanca memorial in 1965 ( he was second half- a-point behind the champion ) and the Piatigorsky Cup in 1966 ( second , by half-a-point ) .
In the 1960 Leipzig Olympiad , Fischer had met the former world champion Mikhail Tal , that master of sacrifices , and though the game - a French Defence - ended in 21-move draw it is considered one of most exciting draws in chess ever .
Even Mikhail Botvinnik , who was the world champion from 1948 to 1963 and who started the great Soviet chess revolution , acknowledged that Fischer could become a world champion .
Later that evening he met another Iceland chess player and repeated to him every word the little Olaffson girl had told him over telephone .
