Stop the violence

For more than two years now , the archipelago has been gripped by violence , street fights , communal flare-ups and calls for separation .
This was considered to be an oasis of communal harmony in the country , even during the height of the showdown between the majority Muslims and the minority ethnic Chinese at the height of the economic crisis in 1997 .
In a bid to contain the violence , the military ( TNI ) has taken over control of the Spice Islands , but even it will need time to quell the rebellion and douse the fires .
Before the new President , Mr. Abdurrahman Wahid , could settle down in office and complete a round of visits to his neighbouring countries violence erupted in Aceh , for the right to self-determination and independence .
In addition to the undercurrent of a divide between the dominant race from Java and those living in Sumatra , the new administration has also to deal with the simmering problems in a host of islands , particularly Irian Jaya .
It is now up to the President to undertake a serious reform of the Constitution and the electoral system to ensure that the People 's Representative Assembly truly becomes representative of the people from across the archipelago .
