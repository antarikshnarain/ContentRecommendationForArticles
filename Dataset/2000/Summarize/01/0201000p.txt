NHRC awards compensation for 'illegal detention'

The Commission has also recommended to the Government to get cases registered against the police officials involved in illegal detention , physical abuse and removal of cash and jewellery from the boy .
The Commission also found it unacceptable that a senior officer of the rank of SP could not hold an inquiry just because an official under him had been transferred .
' ' The NHRC received a complaint from the boy , Jaya Kumar Sahu , alleging that he was arrested by the Phulbani police who had also taken away Rs .
On the directions of the Commission , the SP conducted an inquiry and stated that the complainant and another person were arrested on charges of theft and smuggling of gem stones .
In its order , the Commission felt that letting an officer for illegally detaining the petitioner , simply by administering a ` censure'-can not be said to be adequate punishment by any standard keeping in view the gravity of the acts committed , which constituted certain penal offences .
Besides recommending registration of cases against the police officials , the Commission also suggested initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the SP for his total lack of sensitivity towards human rights problems of the citizens .
