Life of a legend

Did you know that Enid Blyton - the creator of characters like Noddy , Fatty , George - almost made music her career ?
Enid Blyton 's aunt was a gifted musician and her father loved music .
While Enid Blyton learned music - sonatas and nocturnes and passed one music examination after the other - she wondered how she could tell her parents that she did not want a career in music .
So Enid wrote whatever she wanted - in secret , because almost everything she wrote came back with unfailing regularity .
Miss Blyton told Bible stories to the children there - in simple words , drawing and painting pictures on the wall , as well as helping in the handwork the children did .
Then she would get the opportunity to spend her days with children which would help her find out their likes and dislikes , how they looked at the world , their dreams , their fears , what they admired , what they liked to read and what they hated - in short , Miss Blyton would get to see the effect of her stories in her own students .
