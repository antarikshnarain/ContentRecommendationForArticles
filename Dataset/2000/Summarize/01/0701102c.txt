Navratilova, the toast 

THE SENSE of occasion demanded something quite extraordinary - an appropriately epic victory against her greatest rival , Steffi Graf , perhaps - but , just as the Centre Court crowds could never quite bring themselves to love her , when the gods finally decided to bestow sporting immortality upon Martina Navratilova , they did so almost grudgingly .
` ` She plays like a man,' ' became the popular refrain of those who blithely chose to overlook the fact that Navratilova did anything but ; she played in the style of Margaret Court , Maria Bueno and Suzanne Lenglen before her , displaying complete all-court mastery allied to the new female weapons - awesome power and athleticism .
As lean as a whippet and as fast as the wind , she won the first of her three Olympic gold medals as an 18-year-old member of the Polish 4 x 100 metres relay squad at Tokyo in 1964 when she also collected silver in the 200 metres and long jump .
I wish I had seen Mildred ` Babe ' Didrikson in person , for many are those who regard her as an early day ` Wilson the Super- Athlete ' ; at the U.S. Olympic trials of 1932 , Didrikson won the high jump , shot putt , javelin , 80m hurdles and the then popular ` baseball throw' .
' ' As her prowess at track and field began to wane , Didrikson ( ` ` Before I was even in my teens , my goal was to be the greatest athlete who ever lived' ' ) took up golf , turning professional in 1947 after becoming the first American to win Britain 's Amateur Championship .
As balletic as Bueno , as iron-willed as Borg , Lenglen won Wimbledon from 1919-1923 and in 1925 , remaining unbeaten anywhere in the world from the age of 14 , although her retirement due to illness when trailing American Molla Mallory in the 1921 U.S . Championship final aroused heated debate on newspaper front pages across the world .
