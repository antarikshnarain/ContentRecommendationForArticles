Hijack 'episode', a call to beef up security

While there were welcome signs of relief over the end to the eight-day-long hijack drama and safe return of hostages to the Capital tonight , security experts felt the ` ` episode' ' served as a wake-up call to India to embark upon a total rethinking in its strategy towards tackling terrorism and plugging loopholes in the country 's security management system .
Without going into specific details , Mr. Gill told The Hinduthat there was an urgent need for rethinking the strategy on tackling militancy and terrorism .
Mr. Gill was firmly opposed to the idea of accepting the hijackers ' demand for the release of Maulana Azhar and other militants but said there could be ` ` no hard and fast rules' ' in a human situation .
Mr. Rajeshwar said that security at airports and vital installations should be tightened and in hijack-prone sectors security check should be introduced just before passengers embark the aircraft .
Meanwhile , Union Home Ministry tonight advised all the State Governments to observe ` ` perfect security drill' ' at all domestic and international airports .
According to the official spokesman of the Ministry , the States have been asked to tighten the security network in the civil aviation sector as subversive groups may try to take advantage of ` ` security loopholes .
