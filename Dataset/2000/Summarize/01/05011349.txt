Taliban's origins: Deoband, U.P., 1867 

` All Umma is one ' According to the Taliban 's version of the Deobandi school of jurisprudence , the adoption of local practices led to dilution of the laws laid down by the Prophet .
The Taliban subscribes to a sect of Deobandi school which broke away after Kamal Ataturk propounded the concept of secular Islam by abolishing the Friday namaz in Turkey .
After partition , the Indian wing called Jamiat-ul- Ulema-e-Hind ( JUI ) acquired a pro-Congress tint while the theology of pan- Islamisation was propagated by the JUI at a low ebb in Pakistan .
The JEI mullahs exhorted their Taliban ( students ) to cleanse Islam from cross-cultural influences by waging war against all those trying to dilute Islam .
The Taliban was told its task was not just to cleanse Islam of cross-cultural influences and establish the rule of Allah but also to wage war against Russia and India , specially the former for attempting to extend influence in bordering Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and its support to warlords in the non-Pushtun northern Afghanistan who have consistently opposed the Taliban .
While there are many differences between the Wahabis ( Ahle-Hadiz ) and the JUI 's version of the Deobandi school of jurisprudence , they are both averse to praying at Dargahs and to observing Muharram .
