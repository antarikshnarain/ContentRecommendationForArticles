Tendulkar, McGrath prove their superiority

Attendance for Test matches grew manifold the world over , some new talent emerged on the horizon and some thrilling contests in both the versions of the game made it a memorable year both for the connoisseur and the layman .
It was a pleasant coincidence that in an era dominated by the limited overs monster , six nations - India , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , West Indies and England - were involved with Test cricket at the same time as 1999 passed into history books .
That one match signified all that is exciting about limited overs cricket and there were quite a few Test matches , too , which kept the fans on the edges of their seats .
The ` Anil Kumble Test ' at the Ferozeshah Kotla in Delhi in which he grabbed all the 10 wickets in Pakistan 's second innings to become only the second bowler in the history of the game to achieve the feat .
Among the batsmen , Sachin Tendulkar expectedly dominated by scoring 1000 runs in one calendar year , but he had company in Michael Slater and Steve Waugh , two gritty performers known to score runs in difficult times .
National shame The biggest shame was an empty Eden Gardens witnessing an Indian debacle , a few days after a magnificent Chennai crowd had stood applauding the conquerors of their team at the Chepauk .
