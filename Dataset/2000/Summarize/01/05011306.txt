They don't fit the bill

The ruckus appears to be over the failure to provide a sub-quota for OBCs and Muslims within the 33 per cent reservation for women stipulated in the Bill .
P. J. Bagilthaya , Bangalore Sir , - ` ` We never wanted the Bill torn up but the manner in which it was introduced forced us to tear it up' ' , was the Samajwadi Party leader , Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav 's comment .
` ` We do n't care whether you wanted the Bill torn up , Mr. Mulayam but your MP has to fight his election again' ' is the message which needs to be sent .
Let the MP go back to the people and tell them why he resorted to physical violence and if they pardon him , then by all means he could return to Parliament .
