The moments that will live forever

They have one thing in common ; they all happened and will never completely unhappen.. . Cassius Clay v Sonny Liston , Miami , Feb 25 , 1964 : Liston was an ogre , a fearsome ex-convict who could petrify opponents with a look as hard and cold as a tombstone .
Real Madrid 7 , Eintracht Frankfurt 3 , European Cup final , Glasgow , May 18 , 1960 : Football has never provided 90 minutes of such magic ; the pace and wizardry of Gento on the left touchline , the poise and panache of Di Stefano , the power and accuracy of Puskas 's left foot .
England v Australia , Cricket Test , Headingley , 1981 : The fat lady had sung and was sitting at home with her feet up when Ian Botham came into bat with England , which was following-on , still 92 runs behind and seven second-innings wickets down .
Foinavon wins Grand National,Aintree , 1967 : The Grand National never fails to weave the most romantic of tales : Red Rum 's three victories , Bob Champion and Aldaniti 's heroic adventure , Devon Loch 's tragic misadventure within yards of victory .
The Shot Heard Round The World , The Polo Grounds , New York , Oct 3 , 1951 : Trailing their bitter rivals , the Brooklyn Dodgers , by 13-1/2 games , the New York Giants won 37 of their last 44 games to take the National League baseball championship into a play- off .
' ' Europe v United States , Ryder Cup , The Belfry , 1985 : He stands there yet , arms raised in triumph , a rolled-up fag behind one ear , a great cheesy grin on his face , and the tears beginning to turn his famous Groucho Marx moustache into a soggy quagmire .
