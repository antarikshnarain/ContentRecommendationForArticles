A barefoot friend of the tiger 

While the seminar circuit and policy-movers were arguing intensely over the merits of ` ` think global , act local' ' , in Delhi one dhoti-clad barefoot young man was already doing his micro-bit in the ` ` act local' ' department , co-opting irascible , civilisation-wary tribals into forest protection in the remote recesses of Kerala 's Periyar Tiger Reserve , a rib of the spiny Western Ghats .
Mr. S. Guruvayurappan , in the Capital recently to receive the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) Tiger Conservation Award 1999 for ` notable work in involving people in tiger conservation ' , is not the sort of greenie such as Ms. Medha Patkar , Mr. Sunderlal Bahuguna , who are usually expected by the anything-but-green lobby to be apologetic about being , well , greenies , and coming in the way of development and progress .
When he joined the World Bank- approved eco-development project launched at the Periyar Tiger Reserve , neither the forest authorities nor the tribals he was supposed to ` convert ' , thought the project would work .
There were the 20-odd poachers who were playing havoc with the predator-prey balance , and did n't care a hoot if the last tiger in Periyar wound up eviscerated and sold in the illegal market for wildlife products .
From working out the annual needs of forest produce , firewood , and activities such as grazing , to determining the legal status of the village vis-a-vis the forest , and crackdown on poachers , the villagers decide for themselves .
So successful has PAMIA been in demonstrating the workability of the participatory approach followed in the eco- development committees , with a forest official merely taking part in an ex- officio status , that the World Bank has recognised it as a suitable model for India .
