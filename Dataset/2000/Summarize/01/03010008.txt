U.S. makes nation-wide security sweep 

As the Americans made their countdown for the new year , century and millennium , law enforcement authorities made a security sweep of the country , and in the process , nabbed one or two suspects involved with an Algerian national , Ahmed Ressam , who was arrested in the State of Washington three weeks ago .
In the case of Ressam , one assumption is that since he was caught around the time of New Year and was in possession of deadly chemicals or even plastic explosives , he must have been planning for ` ` hits' ' on New Year 's eve .
In documents filed in court , prosecutors are making the point that both Ressam and Lucia Garofalo belong to the same cell of a ` ` violent Algerian terrorist organisation' ' called the GIA .
Police , in their sweep across the country , are also focussing on suspected associates of Ressam ; and have been detaining people in several cities with a view to putting up a strong case against the Algerian national .
The concerted action by law enforcement authorities have not gone without criticism in many quarters , the main one being that Arab Americans are being singled out in the process and the community made to look bad on account on the constant attention of the enforcement and the media .
