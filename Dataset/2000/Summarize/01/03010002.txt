'U.S., India were in constant touch'

The level of cooperation and interaction over the hijacking incident between New Delhi and Washington was high ; and one of the main issues was how to go about the problem given the fact that Washington , too , did not have relations with the Taliban in Afghanistan , the Indian Ambassador Mr. Naresh Chandra said here today .
For instance , Mr. Chandra had at least three meetings with the Deputy Secretary of State , Mr. Strobe Talbott , as also meetings with the Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs , Mr. Thomas Pickering , and the Senior Director for Near East and South Asia at the National Security Council , Mr. Bruce Riedel .
The United States , Mr . Chandra said , was very supportive of the efforts of the Indian Government and the administration had been in constant touch in both New Delhi and Washington .
Asked if there was a particular reason for the ` ` silence' ' on the part of the administration for three days before a statement was put out by the State Department , and an identical message from the White House , Mr. Chandra maintained that there was no special reason for the delay .
Clinton visit on The hijacking will not have an impact on the visit of the President , Mr. Bill Clinton , to India as has been suggested in a section of the media here .
The fact that groups like the Harkat-ul Ansar and the Harkat-ul Mujahideen ` ` flourish' ' in Pakistan could not go unnoticed ; and the initial induction of the ` ` Sikh factor' ' was sinister and diabolical and intended to throw one off the scent .
