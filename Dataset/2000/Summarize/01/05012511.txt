Security at the airports 

WITH INDIAN AIRLINES earning the dubious distinction of being the ` most hijacked airline ' , it is time for the Civil Aviation authorities to take a closer look at security both at the airports and in the aircraft .
But given the choice between a security threat or minor inconveniences , the passengers can not object to extra precautions in the wake of the recent hijacking of Indian Airlines IC 814 .
The authorities will have to look at international and national airports in the country , as well as measures to be taken at foreign airports , when the national carriers have no say in the systems .
Video cameras have to be installed at the security check-points , escalators , entries to the toilets and all entry and exit points of the terminal building , so that a central control room can constantly monitor the entire area and maintain a vigil .
Equally disconcerting is the reported transcript of the conversation between the pilot of the hijacked aircraft and the Air Traffic Control ( ATC ) Tower at the Amritsar airport .
But till 7-49 p.m. , when IC 814 took off in a hurry , there was no bowser to refuel the aircraft , nor any plan of action in place to deal with the crisis .
