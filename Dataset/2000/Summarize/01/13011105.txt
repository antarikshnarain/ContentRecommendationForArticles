Crow in my balcony

It was on a hot , humid morning in August that I was telling the children a story about Baaka Kaaka , the cunning crow .
Finding it impossible to remove , he rummaged in the waste paper basket , and went off with a rolled piece of twine and came back to collect old pieces of plastic , some rags and whatever he thought was useful .
One day Baaka Kaaka brought his wife Baaki Kaaka for a final choice on furnishings .
" One fine day , I saw Baaki sitting in the nest with her wings half spread out and Baaka was circling over her and shouting " Caw , caw , caw .
There was Baaki Kaaka feeding them with morsels , not fast enough , I am afraid , as they looked so hungry , with their beaks open all the time .
Baaka Kaaka hung around , collecting whatever he could and flew to the nest as fast as he found them .
