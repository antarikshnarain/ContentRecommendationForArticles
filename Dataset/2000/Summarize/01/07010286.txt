A disappointing experience 

For chairman , Mr. Chandu Borde , one among the first three Indian batsmen to cross the 3000 mark in Test cricket and acknowledged as a fine batsman in his times , it has been , sadly to say , a very disappointing , nay a frustrating experience in the last three months .
It was sheer accident that saw him once again become the chairman of the selection committee at the Board of Control for Cricket in India 's Annual Generalbody Meeting in Jaipur in late September ; a majority of the West Zone members of the BCCI , unhappy with the way Ajit Wadekar had gone about in functioning as chairman .
Mr. Borde , regarded by many as one of the shrewdest in the game and with an eye for spotting talent and passing quick judgment , was himself disappointed , but probably did not feel a sense of remorse , having been a party in not choosing Gunjal for the tour .
He did not appear to be miffed after enduring a marathon four hour meeting , much of which was spent in presenting his colleagues ' point of view to Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar and patiently listening to them , mainly on what has been a vexing issue for three months .
' ' The selectors are upset , not only because the Indians lost the Adelaide and Melbourne Tests by a big margin , but also because the team management have not given opportunities to off- spinner Harbhajan Singh and medium pacer Thirunavukarasu Kumaran .
But after another round of a selection committee meeting , this season 's sixth , the selectors , have given only the impression that picking an Indian team is a real chore , not one that has given them joy .
