What really happened at Amritsar? 

Not only do they claim that there were no clear instructions from the Crisis Management Group ( CMG ) , which was meeting in Delhi , the State police also did not have equipment or trained personnel required to deal with such exigencies .
Though sketchy information regarding what transpired between the Amritsar ATC and the pilot of IC 814 is available , the communication between the ATC , senior officers of the Punjab Government and CMG , remains closely guarded , giving rise to speculation .
According to information from sources and accounts of eyewitnesses , the sequence of the events of on the fateful day was : At about 6-35 p.m. the aircraft is seen hovering over Amritsar and the ATC refuses permission to land but subsequently allows following a distress message from the pilot , who tells the ATC that he has barely 20 minutes of fuel on board .
A posse of commandos of the Punjab Armed Police ( PAP ) takes position as the plane lands on tarmac 34 and comes to a halt at the far end of the runway , which is not well-lit and is quite far from the floodlight apron area .
At 7-10 p.m. the first contact with Delhi is established when the Cabinet Secretary calls up giving no specific instructions except asking the officers in the control tower to ensure that refuelling is delayed to prolong the matters .
At about 7-40 p.m. the plane takes another turn of 180 degrees and faces south and after about 10 minutes it surprises everybody with a takeoff without seeking clearance from the ATC or using the entire length of the runway .
