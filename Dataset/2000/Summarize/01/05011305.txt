A searching question 

Three professors including myself were waiting at the Patna airport for our baggage to be scanned before we boarded an Indian Airlines aircraft to go to Lucknow .
But no scanning was done and , asked about it , an official of the Airport Authority said , ` ` We are short of hands ; therefore , there will be no scanning .
When I argued that baggage scanning and security check of all passengers were paramount in air travel , he was in no mood to listen and left the scene .
In July 1989 , I was in Paris ; the baggage was scanned at the airport before I left for London .
Again , the baggage was subjected to a thorough check at Heathrow before I emplaned for Chennai .
If it is true that the hijackers hopped from a PIA aircraft and boarded the IA flight at Kathmandu , how were they , in the first place , allowed at Lahore to carry weapons with them ?
