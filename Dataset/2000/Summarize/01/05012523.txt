The wise elephant 

India has recently emerged as a vibrant , free market democracy after the economic reforms and it has begun to flex its muscles in the global information economy .
In stubbornly persisting with the wrong model of development ( especially after 1970 , when there was clear evidence that this path was doomed ) , they suppressed growth and jobs and denied their people an opportunity to rise above poverty .
India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled , perhaps , only by the ascent of Japan 's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration , which helped transform Japan from an underdeveloped group of islands into a thriving , modern society and economy .
One , is a liberal revolution that has swept the globe in the past decade , opened economies that were isolated for 50 years and integrated them spectacularly into one global economy .
This curious historic inversion means that India 's future will not be a creation of unbridled capitalism , but it will evolve through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste , religion and the village , the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years , and they new forces of global capitalism .
These ` ` million negotiations of democracy' ' , the plurality of interests , the contentious nature of our people , and the lack of discipline and teamwork imply that the pace of economic reforms will be slow and incremental .
