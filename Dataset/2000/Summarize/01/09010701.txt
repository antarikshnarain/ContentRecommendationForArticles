Trio on a musical trip 

FIRST THERE were the three Parasuram brothers - Viswanath , Narayan and Sriram .
' Though two of the three brothers are based in Chennai and are fairly popular in the city 's December classical circuit , it was for the first time that the ` 3 brothers.... ' were on stage together .
But the idea of 3 brothers & a violin is a fairly recent one,' ' says Sriram , a VJTI alumnus is also management graduate from IIM , Calcutta .
The youngest of the brothers , Narayan , graduated from IIT , Mumbai , before securing a Masters from Clemson University , U.S .
The compositions and the singing seek to blend the fresh with the familiar,' ' says Viswanath , the eldest , who is a vocalist and a classical mridangam percussionist .
Many of the present attempts at fusion , seen around is either ` layering ' of music or plain ` jamming' .
