Appu and D'Silva corner glory 

Flying Monarch 's consistency over long trips eventually paid off when this gelding outstayed his rivals to bundle them into one heap as he took this 2200m race in a facile manner .
Although winning this race from the start , Appu had to exert and bring out the maximum from this mare for her to lift the prize as Stewart and Cool Riddin , especially the latter , strutted in with a sound gallop to be fastest at the finish .
Always having the trump card in hand , Blitz Craig made a superb impact on his more experienced rivals by dishing out special treatment with his powerful turn of foot that carried him clear to win by over three lengths from Splendid King who made a flashy appearance from the rear to be an isolated second ahead of Patton , a lightly raced 5 year old , who is regaining some lost ground and could be reaching for better places next time .
A filly who expressed her appreciation of her educational run was Abbatale who gave trainer Satheesh a sound warning that her swinging finish for second place puts her on target to strike when wanted .
This Equus bred gelding set off smartly and ran a mature race for a first timer , clipping along in style for a comfortable win and an effortless ride for Samad .
The condition that non winners since July 1 this year can only run , made things easier for Meri Merzi and Bonny Scot , both top weights , who will now be back in Cat .
