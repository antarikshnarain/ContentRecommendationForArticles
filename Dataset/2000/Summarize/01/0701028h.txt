Bradman still casts a giant shadow 

Sir Donald Bradman , 91 and living a reclusive life in Adelaide , Australia , was pioneer of self-promotion , using his enormous profile to make money off the field decades before sports got engulfed by commercialism .
Others , notably England with Jack Hobbs , Walter Hammond , Herbert Sutcliffe and later Ian Botham , and then the West Indies , with their fearsome fast bowlers from Wes Hall to Curtly Ambrose and the genius of Clive Lloyd , Viv Richards and Brian Lara , enjoyed periods of greatness before falling from the peak .
Of those still playing , India 's little master Sachin Tendulkar is 11 places below Bradman on 56.68 and Lara , the world record holder for most runs in a Test innings with 375 , is 21st at 51.98 .
` ` Figures are not entirely conclusive but it is difficult to avoid their significance if a man produces them year after year against every type of opponent and under all conceivable conditions,' ' said Bradman in his book ` ` Farewell to Cricket .
He rated his 254 in the second Test at Lord 's as his finest moment because ` ` practically without exception every ball went where it was intended to go , : and it made him the youngest player to score a Test double hundred .
The English called the tactic ` ` leg theory' ' but the Australian description of ` ` Bodyline' ' better reflected the menace and the pain suffered when several players were hit by paceman Harold Larwood 's thunderbolts .
