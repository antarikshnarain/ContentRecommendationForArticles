Instant but lasting impression 

Chennai has its own equivalent of street artists , though only temporary - at the festival of Crafts and Food being held at Gandhi Mandapam , Guindy .
Students from the Government College or Arts and Crafts , Kumbakonam , help visitors get an instant portrait , using pencil on paper , for Rs.50 .
Mr. Sudam Charan Swain from Raghurajpur near Puri , says the images are first sketched on the leaves and etched with a sharp tool .
Lace , kalamkari and bidri work from Andhra Pradesh , wooden jewellery and sandal wood carvings from Karnataka , palm leaf and leather crafts from Pondicherry , semi-precious stones and silk paintings from Punjab , stone and wood carvings , terracotta from Uttar Pradesh , cotton sarees from West Bengal , coir products and ` pattachitra ' - water colour painting on cloth from Orissa , footwear and sandalwood toys from Rajasthan are some of the crafts which the festival has put on show , with the promise that the participants are ` ` genuine craftspersons .
Apart from the icons , terracotta and stone images from Tamil Nadu , ` Madurai sungudi ' sarees are available .
While the pieces of ethnic craft beckon the visitors ' , it is the artists who help them leave with an indelible impression - the instant portrait .
