Some plain speak on policy 

Barring puritan theorists who revel in arcane controversies about the autonomy of the RBI , analysts of the interface between monetary and fiscal policy in India , over the years , have almost uniformly been impressed by the mutual vibrations between the monetary authority and the Government .
While in the pre-1991 period , the general tenor of the annual reports on currency and finance was one of plaintive concern on the part of the RBI , over the deterioration in fiscal discipline of the Government , the RBI has in more recent years shifted gears in favour of prevention of the Government from taking the central bank for granted in the matter of ways and means advances .
While the first component has a lot to do with the dynamics of the economy and with the growth of the GDP , the latter broadly encompasses the relative inflexibility of expenditure ( administration , interest charges and subsidies ) and the stickiness in revenue generation , as evidenced by the stagnation ( or decline ?
But what is instructive in the new dissection of fiscal deficit is that the Government can not hope to solve the impasse on the fiscal front except through the reduction of the public debt ( thereby bringing down the interest commitments ) and the augmentation of tax revenue through a determined course of taxation of the services sector which now accounts for almost 48 per cent of the GDP .
The RBI has indeed done well to disabuse large sections of the export community of the abject supposition that the role of the RBI in management of the exchange rate for the rupee is that of keeping the currency at as low a level in relation to the U.S . dollar as would impart competitive strength to Indian exports ( through lower international prices ) .
But the rider in the RBI postulation is that most banks can not afford to reduce their lending rates , given their own structural rigidities ( as evidenced by the wide margins they need to keep themselves in a state of profitability ) apart from deposit rates which can not be brought down without the risk of a decline in their rate of growth .
