Hijackers headed for Kashmir?

As the terrorists-for-hostages deal was implemented without an apparent hitch this evening at the Kandahar airport , the hijackers of the Indian Airlines airbus , along with the released militants , were expected to ` ` go to Kashmir' ' via Pakistan .
Let them go to Kashmir,' ' Mullah Omar , Taliban Amir-ul-Momineen , was quoted as telling Mr. Rahimullah Yusufzai , Peshawar-based correspondent of The News .
Mr. Yusufzai told this correspondent that to Mullah Omar the route they took ( which has to be via Pakistan ) was irrelevant .
Earlier , reports from Kandahar confirmed that soon after the Boeing 737 carrying the External Affairs Minister , Mr. Jaswant Singh , landed there , the three prisoners taken from Indian jails were whisked away in a Taliban vehicle .
Clearly , if the hijackers , who have been allowed to go scot-free by the Taliban , along with the militants , cross the border into Pakistan , then they could go anywhere .
` Humanitarian grounds ' Mullah Omar also made it clear that the Taliban 's actions in ending the crisis were determined by ` ` humanitarian considerations' ' , not by any desire to secure international or Indian recognition .
