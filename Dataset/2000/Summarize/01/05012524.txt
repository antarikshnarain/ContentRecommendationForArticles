The Seattle chaos 

After achieving significant gains in the Uruguay Round in 1994 , the major developed countries , with the joint determination of their Governments and multinational firms , proceed immediately to press for further gains in an aggressive manner .
Then in Geneva in May 1998 , the U.S. pushed a totally new proposal , an agreement on stand-still in electronic commerce , which simply meant a commitment for zero duty on this mode of trade .
The aggressive ambitions of the major developed countries were further topped up by the clear announcement of the U.S . President , Mr. Bill Clinton , at Seattle that there must be an agreement on the provision for trade sanctions for use of child labour in manufacture of exported products .
The unity in this group , and in the wider group of developing countries , was strengthened by the strong opposition to the U.S . proposal for including labour standards in the WTO agenda .
The developing countries had been unanimous at Singapore in opposing any linkage of labour standards with trade in the WTO and had expressed objections repeatedly thereafter whenever this issue was raised .
Seattle will be remembered for many things , for example , for the extreme inconvenience caused to the visiting Ministers , high officials , NGOs , presspersons and others , including physical injuries to some of them ; for the extraordinary situation in which a large number of Governments openly and formally criticised the arrangements made by the host country ; and for the negative approach of the host country on the results of the conference .
