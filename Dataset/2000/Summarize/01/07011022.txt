Into the new millennium... Gold Flake Open reflects the game's cultural leap 

The teenaged threesome , clad in designer jeans and viewing the world around them through trendy sunglasses , arrived chauffeur-driven in an Opel Astra , stuck a slab of chewing gum each into their mouths and briskly made their way to one of the outside courts at the Nungambakkam Tennis Stadium on Friday .
As tennis fast-forwards into the new millennium , the changes are nowhere more evident than in this city where the game 's most popular stage - the Nungambakkam Tennis Stadium - bears little resemblance to the hallowed home of the game of another era , the dilapidated old Egmore stadium , whose cow-dung splashed courts reverberated to the dancing feet of the Frasers , Nastases and the Krishnans .
What is more , the complexion of the crowds - vis a vis their expectations from a tennis event - has vastly changed too as much as the bank balance that a top player visiting this city for a tennis tournament might boast of , these days .
Almost a half century ago , an upright gentleman used to ride a few miles on his old AJS motorcycle - his chubby young son seated in the rear with a wooden racquet tucked under his arm - to the Egmore stadium , both father and son dreaming a hundred dreams of glory .
As with any major tennis tournament on the ATP Tour in other parts of the world , the Gold Flake Open is an entertainment package designed to cater to fans and players whose demands are hardly comparable to their predecessors ' in the Ramanathan Krishnan era .
At the venue itself , things seem to be falling in place to get everything ready in time for the tournament even as the lesser mortals of the tennis world , the lowly ranked players , are busy practising for the qualifying event which is scheduled to be held on Sunday and Monday .
