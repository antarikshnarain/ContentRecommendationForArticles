'London Eye' comes to a grinding halt 

Lingering worries about the impact of the ` ` millenium bug' ' on computer systems as well as embarrassing organisational slips have cast a small shadow over the elaborate preparations that Britain has made to welcome the new millenium .
But despite months of preparation and a large budget , the organisers failed to take the elementary precaution of sending out invitations in time to the several thousand celebrities and guests who will be present at the ceremony .
Another major millenium attraction , a huge ferris wheel known as the ` ` London Eye' ' , which was supposed to give passengers a panoramic view of the city 's sky line , will not open as scheduled tonight after a clutch on one of its passenger capsules was found to be defective .
There is growing confidence though that one of the big worries of the millenium - the crash of the computer systems that control everthing from electricity generation to automatic teller machines in banks will not happen .
Fears of air traffic control and communciation systems failing appear to have diminished after the Government and private businesses spent millions of pounds rectifying potential faults .
Analysts have , however , warned that millenium bug related problems will not be confined to New Year 's day alone but are likely to surface in the weeks that follow .
