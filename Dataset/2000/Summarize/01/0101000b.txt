BJP's 'hard state' line takes a beating

The release of three top militants - Maulvi Masood Azhar , Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and Ahmed Omar Sayeed Sheikh - in exchange for the safe return of the passengers and crew of the hijacked plane has virtually demolished the BJP 's claim that it wants to change the image of the ` ` soft Indian state'' .
It has barely recovered from its Chennai session where it made an attempt to virtually deny its own right-wing Hindutva ideology when it has been hit by the harsh truth of the soft ` ` deal' ' hammered out at Kandahar .
Neither can it be said that the Government kept ` ` nationalism' ' in mind or showed ` ` character' ' when the country was forced to see its External Affairs Minister personally carrying and safely delivering to Kandahar the terrorists , whose release the hijackers had demanded .
Throughout the eight-day crisis the Government maintained that it would keep two key objectives in mind while trying to find a solution to the crisis - ` ` the safe return of the innocents passengers and crew held as hostages' ' and the ` ` overall national interest'' .
In fact , in 1993 , even as the Narasimha Rao Government was in the midst of the crisis caused by terrorists having holed up inside the Hazratbal shrine in Kashmir , Mr. Advani , then in the opposition , was declaring loudly that while the Rao Government was feeding the terrorists with biriyani the BJP would respond to them with bullets .
All that the so-called ` ` pro-active' ' policy of the Vajpayee Government has achieved is that the militants are now bold enough to attack military and police posts , and even headquarters , when during the preceding years they looked for soft targets - labourers working by the roadside , tourists or passengers in a bus .
