Great relief but a heavy price 

THERE IS A widespread sense of relief and rejoicing that there is finally a safe homecoming for the some 150 Indian citizens and the several foreign nationals who were trapped in a gruesome seven-day ordeal aboard the Indian Airlines flight hijacked last Friday en route from Kathmandu to New Delhi .
It was clear that the group of deranged desperados who showed very little compassion even for the children who were trapped aboard and who did not waver even for a second from their emphatic demand for the release of a bunch of terrorists jailed in India , had planned their chilling strategy down to the last detail .
The deal that the Government was finally forced to agree to - the release of the Harkat-ul-Mujahadeen cleric , Maulana Masood Azhar , two other militants , Ahmed Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Zargar - which came after five days of hard negotiations in Kandahar between Indian negotiators , the Taliban regime and the hijackers is certainly a bitter pill for the country to swallow .
Yet it was a Hobson 's choice , given the fact that more than a hundred innocent lives were at stake and could not on any account be traded in for the continued captivity of a few militants , however dreaded they were and however ominous their release was in terms of the impact it would have on the battle against cross-border terrorism in Kashmir .
The hijackers managed to browbeat the Government of India , virtually spiriting the aircraft away from Amritsar where it had landed for at least a full 40 minutes , adroitly avoiding any stalling action at Lahore or Dubai and finally forcing the plane to land in Kandahar , the stronghold of the Taliban , thus virtually placing more than a hundred Indian lives at the mercy of a fundamentalist regime that has no diplomatic relations with India .
It does appear that the Government 's inability to rescue the hostages without inviting this costly trade-off , even as the hijackers are apparently walking off scotfree into the welcoming arms of their Taliban hosts , has extracted a heavy political cost and could damage India 's prestige internationally .
