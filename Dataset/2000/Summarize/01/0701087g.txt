Polar Falcon trounces field 

RAMASWAMY 'S Polar Falcon , effortlessly ridden by Richard Hughes , made mincemeat of his ten rivals , including two stablemates , while winning the Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri ( Delhi ) sponsored 2,000 Guineas , the last classic of the century here .
Trained by Gurdev Singh , the winner thus effaced the narrow defeat suffered in his maiden attempt here and pushed MAM 's Classic tally to two short of three centuries .
A handy second upto 500m , the bay colt by Azaad out of Himafushi surged forward thereafter to tackle the event by a distance from Endless Quest ( Amyn Merchant ) who , in turn , was a length better than Classic Society ( Rajinder ) .
Classic Society , though slow out , shaped like a runner up around 250m but was deprived of this spot by Endless Quest , winner of the 1,000 Guineas , in a driving finish .
