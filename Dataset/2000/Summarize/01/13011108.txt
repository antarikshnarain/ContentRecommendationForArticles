A smile that was

These are descriptions of Leonardo da Vinci 's painting Mona Lisa .
The Japanese heart specialist , Dr . Harou Nakamura , feels that the yellow pigmentation in the corner of her left eye must have been due to high cholesterol levels and it is likely that Mona Lisa succumbed to heart attack .
While the medical fraternity holds that all was not well with this woman , the wife of a rich Florentine merchant , others from computer imaging and x-ray analysis declare that Mona Lisa was not a woman at all !
The American computer artist , Liillian Schwartz , and Maudsley Hospital registrar , Dr. Digby Quested , believe that Mona Lisa was a mirror image of Leonardo da Vinci himself .
As da Vinci was known to have written many notes on mirror image painting , there was a likelihood that he had drawn his own face by mirror imaging and later converted it to that of a woman .
