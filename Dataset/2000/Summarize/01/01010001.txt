Hostages swapped for three militants 

NEW DELHI , DEC. 31 The week-long hostage crisis ended today when the Vajpayee Government agreed to release ( at least ) three hardcore ` ` Kashmiri' ' terrorists in exchange for the freedom of 155 Indian passengers and the crew members of the hijacked Indian Airlines aircraft .
Speaking to the nation on the eve of the new century , the Prime Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee explained that the government was guided by two concerns : ` ` the safety of the passengers and the crew , and the long-term , overall interests of our country .
' ' Rather defensively the Prime Minister explained that the hijackers had originally demanded the release of 36 terrorists and that ` ` we were able to substantially scale down their demand .
Soon thereafter major international television networks were telecasting images of the five masked hijackers walking up to the car in which sat the Foreign Minister and the three released terrorists .
' ' The three released terrorists are Maulana Masood Azhar ( who was in a Jammu jail ) , Mustaq Ahmed Zarger , ( who was in Srinagar and was brought to Jammu and flown to New Delhi along with the Maulana ) and the third , Ahmed Omar Sayeed Sheikh who was lodged in the Tihar Jail here .
' ' However , later Mr. Jaswant Singh told a press conference in Kandahar , in the presence of Taliban 's Foreign Minister , Mr. Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel that the hijackers would not get asylum in Afghanistan and had been given 10 hours to leave the country .
