The Rocket blazes into tennis immortality 

He did n't think much of my chances because I was so small , but soon after Charlie Hollis took over coaching us in Rockey , Charlie told Dad that I 'd be the best , Laver wrote in his 1971 autobiography , The Education of a Tennis Player .
Anderson early in the century to 1930s stars Crawford , John Bromwich and Adrian quist to 1950s-60s champions Frank Sedgman , Lew Hoad and Rosewall , sparsely populated but sports-crazy Australia was second only to America in capturing Grand Slam titles and Davis Cups .
The Peruvian was allowed to play Davis Cup for the U.S. and later that year dealt Laver a four-set Davis Cup defeat , which Laver said stands as the biggest disappointment of my career , even though Australia pulled out a 3-2 victory in the Challenge Round .
Unheralded countryman Marty Mulligan came within a match point of ending Laver 's dream of a Slam ; then Fraser served for the match at 5-4 in the fifth set ; and in the French final , Laver rallied from two sets down to beat good friend Emerson again .
At the 1969 Australian Open , Roche , a husky lefty with a similar game , battled him in 100-degree heat in what Laver called the longest match I ever played - 90 games - and by far the hardest in a sensational 7-5 , 22- 20 , 9-11 , 1-6 , 6-3 semifinal that Laver somehow won .
After his glory days Laver played World Team Tennis during 1976- 78 - hilariously copping Rookie of the Year honours at 38 - entertained clients at his Laver-Emerson Tennis Holidays , served as a goodwill ambassador for five years on the Nabisco Grand Prix and did clinics at corporate outings at hotels and resorts .
