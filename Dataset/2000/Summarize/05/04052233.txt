Four-lane system likely to be scrapped 

Source said the change of mind resulted from the spate of accidents on the four-lane stretch , especially when vehicles switch lanes , slow pace of movement of vehicles and wastage of road-space .
The stretches from Thiru Vi Ka junction to Anna Flyover , on the Anna flyover , from Anna Flyover to Eldams Road junction , LR Swamy building junction and upto CIT Nagar 1st main road junction are examples' ' , says a planner .
The phenomenal growth of the number of vehicles in the city from 6.41 lakhs when the four-lane system was introduced in 1993 to a staggering 10.78 lakhs now has altered the traffic pattern on Anna Salai .
Those recommending the scrapping of the system claim that in practice the four-lane system only exists between Spencer point to General Patters Road on one side and upto Thiru Vi Ka Road on the opposite side .
It was suggested that priority clearance of buses at intersections along the Anna Salai was more cost effective than extension of the four-lane system .
With no value of time being assigned for slow moving vehicles , the speed of 33 km envisaged for cyclists was beyond the riding speed of cyclists , says the CMDA study .
