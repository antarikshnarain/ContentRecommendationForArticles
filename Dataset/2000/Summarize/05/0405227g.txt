Pondy CM to meet PM today 

The Chief Minister , Mr. R. V. Janakiraman will meet the Prime Minister and Union Home and Finance Ministers again in Delhi on Wednesday to urge them , not to introduce uniform sales tax in the Union Territory .
Nazeem , the Rajya Sabha member , Mr . C. P. Tirunavukkarasu and leaders of parties supporting the Government 's stand would accompany him during his meeting with the Prime Minister and other Ministers .
This is the second visit of the Chief Minister and the DMK MLAs to Delhi to renew their appeal not to apply uniform sales tax pattern on the union territory .
The resolution adopted at the cabinet meeting here on December 31 , would also be presented to the Prime Minister and other Central Ministers to make the union territory 's protest crystal clear .
Thus with the object being the same and only the approach being different he would only appreciate the opposition parties that had decided to go as a joint team to Delhi to meet the Prime Minister and others separately in the next few days .
Mr. Janakiraman said it was the Pondicherry Administration that raised its voice against the uniform sales tax much ahead of other States and only then was New Delhi included in the seven member committee ( Standing committee ) to take stock of the situation .
