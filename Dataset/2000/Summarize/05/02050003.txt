CWC meet to discuss hijack issue

The Congress ( I ) has been severely critical of the Government 's crisis management and has already demanded an explanation on why the plane was allowed to fly out of Amritsar ; why the External Affairs Minister , Mr. Jaswant Singh , escorted the three terrorists ( exchanged for the hostages ) to Kandahar ; and why it took as long as 40 minutes for the Prime Minister to be informed of the hijacking .
