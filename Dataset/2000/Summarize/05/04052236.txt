Transport corpn. case takes serious turn 

The case pertaining to ` Jeeva Transport Corporation ' ( JTC ) scam during the previous AIADMK rule today took a serious turn with the counsel for the accused alleging that the CB CID was ` ` threatening' ' prosecution witnesses , who turned hostile .
After the witnesses in the case were examined and the Judge had retired to his chamber in the evening , advocates for the accused alleged that a prosecution witness , Mr. Viswanathan of Karur , who was treated as hostile today , was initially taken to the prosecutor 's room , located by the side of the court hall , and later to the investigating agency 's room in the second floor .
They said this was not the first instance of the investigating agency intimidating witnesses who turned hostile ; on an earlier occasion , another witness was ` ` taken to task' ' by police .
The Judge then called for the Special Public Prosecutor , the Deputy Superintendent of Police concerned , former Transport Minister , Mr. K. A. Sengottaiyan , and former Managing Director of JTC , Mr. Veerappan , accused in the case , and after listening both sides asked them to ensure that they did not give room for unpleasantness within the court and outside in future .
During chief examination , Mr. Viswanathan said his and three other units had supplied 71 bus body kits to JTC and he paid a total of Rs .
The witness said in September 1994 Paramasivam rang him up and told him that the former Transport Minister was coming to Erode and would stay in the Guest House there and that he ( Viswanathan ) should meet him .
