Is it a tailspin?

India 's aviation planners had visualised 'state-of-the-art ' projects , acquisition of contemporary airplanes , creation of air taxi operations to and from gateways , inter-switching of traffic at airport hubs , with building of rapid road and rail connections , the multiplier-effect of infrastructure for millions of overseas visitors , 'new ' terminals , automation , hotels and tourism friendly additives , a vision in marked contrast to what prevails today .
Without going into the substantive details of the aviation policy , its planning and implementation , or delving in too many 'aberrations ' and litany of political about-turns and deviations , ( grounding of A-320 aircraft , now-on-now-off Bangalore airport project , the inexplicable coyness to Tata 's domestic airline proposals , the pendulum-like shifting of intentions when it comes to clearing the acquisition of contemporary airplanes and related technology , boards of management inducted with good intentions but completely hamstrung by a plethora of prevailing compulsions ) , could one reason and rationalise the shortfalls in content and quality of the finished product ?
For , example , the already obsolete air terminals in New Delhi and Mumbai , the country 's main international gateways , the absence of navigational aids such as CAT 111 particularly desirable for landing and taking off at the Delhi Airport during any winter 's fog bound dawn and other state-of-the-art navigational aids , ITDC 's derelict and run down hotels , restaurants , the mock 'hospitality ' towards foreign tourists and so on ; it would suffice to recall here the words of an insider , that our leaders while in office are " long on promises , short on performance .
There is a healthy multiplier effect in this space-age industry , activities embracing the entire gamut of space sciences , aviation medicine and rocket technology spawning new end uses of space-age materials for commonly used products in daily life , international tourism and trans-global transportation of men and materials , where trade and commerce are not defined or limited by cartographic contours but determined by the needs of a growing population and business opportunities .
The airlines quickly need to improve their financial health and must be allowed to evaluate and induct more airplanes , according to their market needs , in addition to the B-747 - 400 airplanes , medium capacity long range ( MCLR ) aircraft such as the MD - 11 , the Airbus A 340-500 , Boeing 's B 767 or even B 777 and other small capacity long range ( SCLR ) aircraft such as the Airbus A 330-200 and Boeing B 717 , and other contemporary 100 seater airplanes , not excluding small capacity short range ( SCSR ) ones such as the turbo-prop ATRs , suitable for various types of operations over domestic routes .
The appalling conditions at airports , the quagmire of management and financial mess facing the two flag operators , inadequate tourism infrastructure , are but a dismal reality of Indian aviation today ; the inadequacy , poor quality and evident limitations in development of related technology , in stark contrast with what our early planners visualised , the enviable dynamics of an entire gamut of the aviation industry , visible in the success of British Airways , infrastructure at Frankfurt airport , its hotels , especially shopping malls , restaurants , transportation links by road and rail , and even the newest at Hong Kong .
