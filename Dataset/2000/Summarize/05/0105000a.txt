Yashwant Sinha to start pre-budget meetings today

Starting off with representatives of the agricultural sector and noted economists , over the next few days consultations have been scheduled with trade union leaders , representatives of small scale industries , consumer organisations , industrialists , financial institutions , scientists , representatives of the entertainment and media industry and , finally , with economic journalists .
This exercise would probably constitute the widest consultations that any Finance Minister has held as part of pre- budget exercises .
This too is a new feature of the pre- budget exercises because in the past , the industry viewpoint was solicited through memoranda presented by various industry segments .
Having presented a widely- accepted budget last year , the Finance Minister now finds that apart from continuing with the rationalisation process for direct and indirect taxes , the most important task before him is controlling expenditure .
That apart , there have been shortfalls on account of the tardy public sector disinvestment exercise and expenditure overshoots in various sector such as defence , which received an additional Rs .
Though balancing revenues and expenditures are the normal task of any Finance Minister , Mr. Sinha 's problem is compounded because of the limited sources of fresh revenue generation .
