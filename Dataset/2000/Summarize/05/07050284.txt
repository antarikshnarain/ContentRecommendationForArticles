Agarkar equals dubious World record

Indian ` all-rounder ' Ajit Agarkar , who holds the World record for fastest 50 wickets in one-day cricket , today equalled another - albeit a dubious one - when he notched up his fifth successive duck in Tests .
Agarkar , dismissed first ball in a row in the last four innings , fell to the second ball he faced in the third Test against Australia , which India lost by an innings and 141 runs today , to tie with Australian Bob Holland , who achieved the dubious mark in 1985 .
