A credulous claim 

Sir , - I was amused at reading Mr. Inder Malhotra 's article , ` ` Most mortifying outrage' ' ( TheHindu , Dec. 29 ) , since I happened to be the then Chief Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir and sole negotiator authorised by the State Government to obtain the release of Dr. Rubaiyya Sayeed , daughter of the then Union Home Minister , in exchange for five militants .
If Mr . Malhotra believes that the Chief Secretary of an extremely sensitive State could release five militants in exchange for the Minister 's daughter ` ` off his own bat' ' , he is either incredibly naive or extremely credulous - both qualities least expected of a veteran journalist .
The five militants headed by Abdul Hamid Sheikh were released on the express orders of the then Prime Minister , Mr. V. P. Singh , conveyed to the State Government through the then Cabinet Secretary , Mr. T. N. Seshan , in the early hours of December 13 , 1989 from the chambers of the Prime Minister himself .
Moreover , as late as December 31 , 1999 , Mr. V. P. Singh himself gave the lie to Mr. Malhotra 's assertion while appearing in a programme on the BBC with Mr. Prannoy Roy .
