ASSOCHAM plan to boost investment 

The Chamber president , Mr. Shekhar Bajaj , said the performance of the economy in the current year was commendable despite international sanctions and the Kargil conflict but a ` ` sustained recovery' ' could not be assured unless the Government took speedy steps to improve investment levels .
Mr. Bajaj , therefore , suggested reduction in the interest rate by another two basis points in the medium term , inclusion of most sectors under the 100 per cent automatic approval route except for a small negative list , steps to improve savings in the public sector and entry to more private sector players in the banking sector .
Further , he recommended faster de-reservation of small scale industry , complete overhaul of the legislative and administrative framework to remove impediments to housing and construction sectors , privatisation of long distance and international services in the telecom sector , introduction of a separate legislation to create a dedicated fund for development of highways , larger investment in transport , storage and handling facilities in rural areas and allocation of adequate funds for irrigation and water conservation .
