Enough evidence to damn Pak: Vajpayee

But the Prime Minister , who was speaking to newspersons at an Iftaar party hosted by him , added , ` ` we will disclose it at an appropriate time. ` ` Mr. Vajpayee also insisted that India would try to get the hijackers back in order to make them stand trial here .
To begin with , Mr. Advani denied reports in a section of the media that he was furious with the External Affairs Minister , Mr . Jaswant Singh , and the National Security Adviser , Mr. Brajesh Mishra , for agreeing to release three militants in exchange for the Indian Airlines passengers and crew .
Mr. Advani said that along with the Defence Minister , Mr. George Fernandes , he was invited by the Prime Minister this morning to join him in getting a detailed briefing on the negotiations with the hijackers .
All that he would concede was that whereas the country 's interests did not suffer , the BJP 's political image indeed got dented in the manner in which the hijack was handled .
The Chief Election Commissioner , Dr. M. S. Gill , came late , but the Attorney- General , Mr. Soli Sorabjee , was in time to do full justice to the excellent delicacies .
And , Mr. Narendrabhai Modi was also there , looking mighty pleased that he fortuitously got a chance to move the main political resolution ( which was to be moved by Mr. Advani but who got held up in New Delhi because of the hijack drama ) at the BJP 's National Council meeting last week in Chennai .
