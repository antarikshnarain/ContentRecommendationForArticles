Overseas medical insurance policies - whether covered under  Sec. 80D

Could you kindly clarify , whether such deduction will be permissible in respect of medical insurance premia paid for overseas medical insurance policy taken for short periods , say three months/six months to cover stay abroad ?
If it is admissible , then whether in the case of Videsh Yatra Mitra policy which covers other items apart from medical insurance , can one claim deduction of medical insurance premium up to the amount payable for overseas medical insurance policy ?
The very first clause of the scheme confines the benefits to ` ` 80 per cent of the amount of such expenses as are actually and necessarily incurred in respect thereof anywhere in India.... " Hence , overseas medical insurance policy and much less Videsh Yatra Mitra will not be covered under Sec .
Nominal interest is also given , while the scheme more or less provides for custody of customers ' gold without charge with the benefit of increased value of gold or for that matter , subject to the loss of fall in value , which at any rate will be the same , if the gold had been kept in personal custody .
194-I requires deduction of tax at source ( TDS ) even at the time of credit of rent to the account of the payee or on payment of cash or cheque as long as the gross rent amount exceeds Rs .
194-I does not provide for such a situation , but a disputed rent credited to a suspense account can not possibly give rise to TDS , because a disputed amount pending in a court can not be taken as due till the matter is adjudicated upon by the court or is accepted by the payer himself following the rationale of the Supreme Court decision in Hindustan Housing and Land Development Trust ( 1986 ) 161 ITR 524 .
