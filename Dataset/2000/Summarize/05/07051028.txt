'King Carlos' disappoints fans again

The handsome Spaniard Carlos Moya and Chennai seems to have a strange relationship , not the kind his adoring fans would have liked .
The man himself has been relatively silent on the international scene having suffered a stress fracture of his back during the US Open and since then had taken a long lay-off .
However , this morning I again felt a soreness in my back and decided I could not risk an injury right at the start of the season,' ' he told a big gathering of mediapersons at a news conference here on Tuesday , the sense of disappoint quite vivid on his face .
Only minutes earlier he had walked on to the centre court to the cheers all round , only to bring about instant silence with his admission that he was ` ` not playing and sorry for the disappointment .
Last time it was my thumb , this time it is my back and I hope next time I can give them my best form,' ' he said .
' ' At the moment , as he understandably put it , ` ` I must check how bad this fresh development on my back is,' ' he said .
