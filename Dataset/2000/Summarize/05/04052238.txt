Tamil medium: Govt. files counter-affidavit

The Government has the power to regulate , modify , introduce any particular language as medium of instruction and implementing any scheme concerning the field of education , insofar as nursery and primary schools are concerned , the State Government has contended .
In its counter-affidavit to the batch of petitions challenging the G.O dated November 19 , 1999 , making Tamil or the mothertongue as medium of instruction in all schools in the State , the Government said the move would not harm anyone , nor infringe any person 's fundamental right .
By saying so , the people running nursery schools were trying to encash the situation by forcing parents to admit their wards in English medium schools , where huge sums were collected as tuition fees .
Vijayakumar , Additional Secretary , School Education Department , stated that all along parents had to admit the children in English medium schools regardless of their option ; whereas after the issue of the G.O. , ` ` the patriotic parents will only be too happy to welcome the policy of the government to introduce Tamil as medium of instruction in all nursery and primary schools'' .
Further , Tamil scholars and savants made a hue and cry that Tamil should be only instruction medium upto Standard V and English taught as a language only to the students from Standard VI .
Denying the averment from school managements that the move would lead to children joining CBSE and Anglo Indian schools , the Government said it was an untenable argument as such the latter group were few and far confined to only urban areas .
