Should black money be wished away?

Over the nine years since 1991 the possibilities of stopping the needless diversion of budgetary resources towards loss-making public enterprises and those of raising resources through disinvestment of Government equity have hardly availed owing to the dominant mindset in the political system which refuses to come to terms with the inexorable need to disband enterprises in the public sector which have become technologically obsolete , economically unsustainable and financially bankrupt .
Despite a Disinvestment Commission making detailed recommendations case-by-case for dealing with 58 public enterprises of the Centre , the spectacle of budgetary resources being spent on paying wages for workers for abstinence from production , goes on thanks to a perversion of political consensus .
The belief that disinvestment itself can generate substantial financial resources for the Government for use in restructuring viable public enterprises and for deployment in the critical infrastructure and social sectors , is fast becoming hypothetical what with the disappointing record in disinvestment .
Revenue buoyancy That the Government can hope to garner increased tax revenue as a consequence of higher rates of GDP growth of 7-8 per cent in the medium term , is a prospect which ought to bring some cheer to the policymakers , granted that expenditure control will not remain as pathetically inefficient as it has been over the years .
There has been a lot of moralising against such schemes but what can not be totally overlooked is that no Government can remain apathetic to the fact that owing to a complexity of socio-political and ethical failures , the generation of black money and the financing of many enterprises in the economy through tainted money , have been a disconcertingly enduring phenomenon .
There are ways in which corporate enterprises engaged in infrastructure development , real estate promotion , house building and in the development of townships , satellite towns etc. , can be encouraged to access black money through bonds and equity ( brought under an amnesty scheme ) .
