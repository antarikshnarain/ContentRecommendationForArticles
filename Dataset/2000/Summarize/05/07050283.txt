A pathetic performance 

Justin Langer was struggling , and looked as though he could fall to Srinath anytime , but with his determination and will to fight , he survived , and went on to compile his career best score .
It has been mentioned earlier in this column that the best way to counter the Aussie bowlers is by attacking them , especially not leaving the loose deliveries go unpunished .
The computer rankings that we keep seeing on the tele- screen seem absurd as they just take into account raw data , like the number of runs scored , or the tally of wickets .
Factors , such as the quality of the batsmen \ bowlers , the type of wickets , playing conditions , and the strength of the opposition , hardly seem to be taken into account .
One finds as many as five Indians in the top 10 , but it does n't count for much , as the performances against a mediocre side like New Zealand , which toured the country earlier in the season , have been taken into account .
Tall scores and big hauls against average opponents on the familiar home pitches inflate the players ' potential and we do not get an accurate projection of the national side .
