'National Conference is a solid rock'

Dr. S. M. Kamaal , Minister ( I&C ; ) , Jammu and Kashmir , writes : This has reference to the news item which has appeared on December .
Let me put the record straight and lay it down for all our political opponents and for the posterity that Dr. Farooq Abdullah , Chief Minister of the State is not only my elder brother but also my leader after Sher-i-Kashmir .
Let it be also reiterated that I am proud of my nephew , Omar Abdullah , who has made it a second time to the Lok Sabha with public mandate and that he is doing extremely well in the Union Council of Ministers .
He had warned us and all the people that sustained efforts will be made by our detractors in destabilising the fortress of National Conference .
The command of National Conference is in the hands of a lovable and dynamic leader , Dr. Farooq Abdullah .
The party general secretary , Sheikh Nazir Ahmed , is not only a dynamic general secretary of the J&K ; National Conference but a proper person to man this very important post for which he has had the good fortune to work under Sher-i-Kashmir .
