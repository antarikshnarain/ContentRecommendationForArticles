Diploma course selection quashed 

The selection of 600 candidates for diploma courses at the cooperative institute , Nagercoil , for 1999-2000 , on the basis of an interview held in July 1999 , has been set aside by the Madras High Court .
The Court held that the entire selection process was liable to be set aside , as it had serious infirmities , including the awarding of 50 marks for the interview .
It directed the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and the Nagercoil institute authorities to hold fresh interview prescribing 15 per cent for the interview and make a fresh selection within a month .
Therefore , the interview was a farce and a mere eye-wash . On the next day , it was seen that at least 510 candidates had been interviewed ; this meant each candidate would have been given 49 seconds for assessing the intellectual ability by four members .
Also , by going through the register of marks , it was clear that the candidates who had got higher marks in higher secondary were given the least mark in the interview ; whereas the candidates with lesser higher secondary marks were given more marks , so that they got selected .
The Judge said the proceedings of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and the guidelines awarding 50 per cent of the marks for interview was arbitrary .
