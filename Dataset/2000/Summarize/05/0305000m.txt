Tudjman's party trounced in Croatian poll 

Mr. Ivica Racan , a former communist and 55-year- old leader of Croatia 's opposition coalition is poised to become the Balkan State 's new Prime Minister following Monday 's Parliamentary polls in which the late President Franjo Tudjman 's HDZ or Croatian Democratic Union Party suffered a crushing defeat .
The two leaders of the Social Democrat and Social Liberal coalition , Mr. Ivica Racan and Mr. Drazen Budisa were euphoric but said they were aware of the voters ' discontent with Tudjman 's party and that the results did not come as a surprise .
Croatia had become something of a pariah with the European Union because of its failure to cooperate with the International War Crimes Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia and because of the discriminating , even racist , policies adopted by the former Government towards the Serbs of Croatia .
` ` These results will ensure European credits for Croatia and perhaps kick off talks about Croatia 's future membership of the European Union,' ' journalist Irina Pavic said .
Tudjman 's party , however , is expected to win the majority of the votes cast by Croats living abroad , particularly in the neighbouring Muslim-Croat Federation where the late President 's intransigent policies find favour with nationalistic , militant Croats .
Tudjman , however , never respected his promises and used fair means and foul to preserve a separate identity for Bosnian Croats by undermining the Dayton agreement which brought peace to the troubled multi-ethnic Balkan Republic .
