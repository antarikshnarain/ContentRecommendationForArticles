W. Asia talks: 'minor' irritants to the fore 

MANAMA ( Bahrain ) JAN. 4 While media attention has focussed on the major issues to be discussed by Syria and Israel in the talks which commenced in Shepherdstown ( West Virginia , U.S. ) yesterday , some relatively ` ` minor' ' issues have come to light .
In the Shepherdstown talks , conducted principally between the Israeli Prime Minister , Mr. Ehud Barak and the Syrian Foreign Minister Mr. Farooq al Sharaa with strong contributions from the U.S. President , Mr. Bill Clinton and his Secretary of State , Ms . Madeleine Albright , the focus is on four major aspects .
Separate joint committees are discussing the questions of the border to be fixed between Israel and Syria , the security guarantees by both sides , the degree and pace of normalisation between them and water distribution from the Golan Heights watershed .
Israel is likely to demand that Damascus close down organisations like the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which have rejected the Oslo processes and are based in Syria .
The cynical view is that the Syrian Government treats these Palestinian organisations as mere chips in the bargaining with Israel but there is an ideological and historical affinity between the Syrian leadership and the DFLP/PFLP .
But if the members of these organisations , which Israel accuses of being actively involved in terrorism , are allowed to settle in territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority then Israel can not argue against the resettlement on these same territories of Palestinian refugees who may not be involved in any political activity .
