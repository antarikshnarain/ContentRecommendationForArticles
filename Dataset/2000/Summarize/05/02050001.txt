Money laundering racket uncovered in Delhi 

The Income Tax Department has come across strong evidence suggesting ` ` criminal misuse' ' of Section 80 HHC of the Income Tax Act , pointing to a flourishing ` ` money laundering' ' racket here by individuals , export firms and unscrupulous elements .
` ` Despite the fact that tax holiday provisions , export incentives and deductions from profits retained from exports have been in the statute for over 15 years , no review or study has been carried out by the Department to evaluate the impact of the scheme .
No records have been maintained in respect of the assesses who are availing the export incentives under various provisions of the Act,' ' the CAG observed in its latest report , which was very critical of the Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) .
Insiders in the CBDT are of the view that the uncapped concessions granted under Section 10A and 10B of the Act to export units should be reviewed immediately and a monitoring mechanism put in place to keep a check on the inflow of money to such units and their ultimate utilisation or destination .
The CBDT had been conducting investigations for quite some time into reports that a large number of export houses had been set up with the purpose of laundering money and routing it into the country through legal channels by exploiting various loopholes .
For this purpose , they tie up with hawala dealers who operate such export units abroad or the export house itself sets up a front in a foreign country to receive the exported item for official purposes .
