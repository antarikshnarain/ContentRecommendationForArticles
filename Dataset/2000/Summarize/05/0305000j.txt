Yeltsin's daughter sacked; Kremlin 'family' still in control

In a high-profile decision , Mr. Putin on Tuesday sacked Ms . Tatyana Dyachenko , younger daughter of the retired President , Mr . Boris Yeltsin , who had served as her father 's image-maker and adviser .
In a series of other changes , clearly designed to distance himself from the scandal-ridden Kremlin administration , the Acting President dismissed Mr. Dmitry Yakushkin , Mr. Yeltsin 's Press Secretary , Mr. Vladimir Shevchenko , chief of the Kremlin protocol sevice , and Mr. Vladimir Semenchenko , director of the President 's chancellery .
The two officials , together with Ms. Dyachenko , formed the core of the infamous ` ` family,' ' a shadowy clan of top Kremlin advisers and politically connected tycoons , who ruled Russia from behind the stage for most of Mr. Yeltsin 's second term .
Ms. Dyachenko 's main role in the Kremlin was to convey to Mr . Yeltsin recommendations of the ` ` family' ' in such a way that the fiercely independent ex-President would not reject them outright .
Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev , the last Soviet President , said in an interview on Tuesday that Ms. Dyachenko and other members of the ` ` family' ' were responsible for persuading Mr. Yeltsin to resign last Friday .
` ` Dyachenko does not need a Kremlin office to continue to pull strings as long as Voloshin and Yumashev stay on,' ' a Kremlin watcher remarked .
