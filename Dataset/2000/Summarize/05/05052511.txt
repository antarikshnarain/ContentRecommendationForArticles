Corporate dealings 

Staid and established businesses such as those in the fast-moving consumer goods industries are adding capacities and more significantly brands , both being considered essential to safeguard as well as expand their markets .
The speed at which a majority of these deals have been struck and the veil of secrecy surrounding them indicate that the profession of deal-making has arrived in India but clearly any other sweeping generalisation is untenable at this stage .
The only logical inference is that Indian companies , having shaken off the pessimism of the recent past , are experimenting as never before to achieve a number of objectives ranging from capacity acquisition to letting go unwanted businesses .
And the SEBI with its ground rules for mergers and acquisitions has provided the regulatory edifice , without which most of the furious deal-making of the past two years could not have been consummated .
As also Hindustan Lever 's reliance on mergers and acquisitions to create for its parent a huge Indian presence in the toiletries , detergents and food businesses .
500-crore deal with Indiaworld for just four India-specific portals seems audacious but is in line with valuations connected with software and internet stocks , which are predicated on the future .
