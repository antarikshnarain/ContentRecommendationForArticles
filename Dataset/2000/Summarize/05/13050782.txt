Small wonder 

In the next two years , as Bihar woke up to the fact that it had a child prodigy , he completed his BSc ( honours ) and MSc in Physics with flying colours from Patna University .
Tathagat , who was honoured with the National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement in 1997 , was in Chennai recently to deliver the ` Millennium address ' on the occasion of the valedictory function of the National Programme for Middle School Students , organised by the St. Johns International Residential School , Palanjur .
At a rapid pace , in a Bihari accent , he talks about ` super conductivity ' , ` quantum field theory ' , ` big bang theory ' , particle physics and similar high sounding canons .
Try talking to him about his personal life and what he does when he is not pondering the mysteries of science , he is almost shy and the pace slows down .
His favourite book is probably the one that he wrote at the age of 10 years , ` ` Electro gravity unification and energy loss phenomenon,' ' but comics and other light reading material will also do fine once in a while .
His father , Prof. Tulsi Narayan Prasad , an erstwhile history professor , claims to have achieved a breakthrough in the field of genetics , adding that he had plotted the genetic patterns for his son , much before his birth .
