Tax benefits of investing in MFs

* Twenty per cent of the amount invested in specified tax savings schemes of mutual funds ( called equity linked savings schemes or ELSS ) is deductible from the tax payable by the investor in a particular year subject to a maximum of Rs .
The 1999 budget has made the mutual fund investor exempt from paying any tax on the dividend received by him from the mutual fund , irrespective of the type of mutual fund .
The dividend tax on mutual funds is advantageous for investors who otherwise are in the 22 per cent or 33 per cent tax brackets , but unfair to those who are in the zero tax bracket .
Unlike TDS , an assessee can not claim refund from IT authorities under the dividend tax.Investment in eligible securities of the entire proceeds obtained from the sale of capital assets for three years or investment of only the profits for seven years , exempts the asset holder from paying capital gains tax .
The units of mutual funds are treated as capital assets and the investor has to pay capital gains tax on the sale proceeds of mutual fund units sold by him .
Thus if a typical growth scheme of an income fund shows a rise of 12 per cent in the net asset value ( NAV ) after one year and the investor sells it , he will pay a 20 per cent tax on the selling price less cost price inclusive of indexation component .
