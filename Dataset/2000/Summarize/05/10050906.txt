Truth, foundation of spiritual life

Though he remained for the better part of his life steeped in spiritual ecstasy , many were drawn to him and his dedicated group of disciples formed the Ramakrishna Order soon after his Mahasamadhi .
He heard of the saint of Dakshineshwar from a friend and his very name struck a responsive chord in his heart as the relationship between them was soon to blossom into that of a Guru and a disciple .
When he expressed that he had a preference for meditating on the formless Absolute , Ramakrishna advised him not to entertain reservations about meditating on God 's forms .
Another important lesson Tarak learnt when the saint urged him to stay on in the Kali temple with him so that he could devote more time to spiritual practice .
Tarak progressed rapidly with the grace of Ramakrishna , his spiritual power having awakened by him and often had vision of God .
Ramakrishna 's spiritual ministry took shape in the form of the Ramakrishna Order when his close disciples renounced worldly life and the Maths at Baranagar , Belur and Almora were established after the saint 's Mahasamadhi .
