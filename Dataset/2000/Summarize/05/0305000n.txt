Wahid-Wiranto discord again? 

The sudden replacement of Indonesia 's national police chief today fuelled speculation in Jakarta about new tensions between the President , Mr. Abudurrahman Wahid , and the highest ranking Minister in his Cabinet , Gen. Wiranto .
It was officially announced today that a police investigation was being held in respect of the alleged massacre of at least 200 Muslims in a village in Halmahera in northern Maluku sector .
Mr. Wahid and Gen. Wiranto , former military chief who still retains his service rank , have in recent weeks differed on issues such as the Army 's alleged human rights abuses in several pockets of Indonesia over a period of time .
Mr. Wahid has held consultations with the Vice-President , Ms . Megawati Sukarnoputri , whom he had asked to rush back home from Hong Kong , and he himself dropped a hint about some impending Cabinet changes .
Meanwhile , Maj. Gen. Zaki Anwar Makarim today testified before the human rights panel on East Timor ( KPP-HAM ) about a contingency plan that the Indonesian military establishment had drawn up to meet the eventuality of a vote against Jakarta in the recent U.N.-sponsored referendum .
