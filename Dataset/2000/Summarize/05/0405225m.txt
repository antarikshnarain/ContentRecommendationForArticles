The issue was raised by the BSP MLA , Mr. Ram Lalit Chaudhury , who complained that installation of handpumps in the rural areas , or the implementation of JRY schemes , and other rural employment- oriented , or poverty elimination schemes besides funds for development of eastern U.P .
Taking a cue from this , the Leader of the Opposition , Mr. Dhani Ram Verma , of the Samajwadi Party made an appeal to the Government to respond to the demand for increase in development fund at the disposal of U.P .
The Leader of the Opposition , Mr. Dhani Ram Verma , made persistent appeal to the Chief Minister to react to the Opposition demand , but Mr. Ram Prakash Gupta maintained a stoic silence .
At this , Mr. Dhani Ram Verma asked his legislators to troop into the well of the House shouting that he would not allow the House proceedings to continue .
Earlier , the CLP leader Mr. Pramod Tiwari through a notice of propriety questioned the Chief Minister s assuming the office of the Leader of the House , when he was not an elected member of the Assembly .
Mr. Dang , however , ruled out the notice and pointed out that at least five times in the past , such leaders who were not member of the Assembly , were sworn in as Chief Minister of U.P .
