Weizman faces graft charge 

The Israeli President , Mr. Ezer Weizman , a crotchety outspoken political veteran , faces pressure to resign over his endorsement of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and revelations that he has accepted substantial undisclosed financial gifts from a French executive .
A blunt opinionated man who has ignored the constraints of his supposedly nonpartisan post , Mr. Weizman outraged the right wing last week when he announced that he would ` ` go home' ' in disappointment if the public voted down an eventual Israeli- Syrian peace deal .
He came under fire again when an investigative journalist revealed last Thursday that Mr. Weizman had received some $ 450,000 in the form of monthly cash allowances between 1988 and 1993 from the executive , Mr. Edouard Zaroussi .
Although Mr. Zaroussi does not have known business ties here , he does own a house here and has been linked with political and business ventures here , according to Israeli news reports .
