Quit all but one post, DMK men told 

Confronted with a serious problem of party bigwigs at the District and Panchayat Union levels cornering several posts in Government and related bodies such as District Cooperative Banks and Milk Cooperatives , the DMK has decided on a hard option to ensure a balance by directing such multiple official posts- holders to quit all but one of them , before filing their nominations for party posts in the ongoing organisational election .
Short of implementing the ` one-man one-post norm ' , the DMK president , Mr. M. Karunanidhi , and its general secretary , Mr. K . Anbazhagan , have now decided that activists and functionaries contesting for the posts of secretary or deputy secretary for party units from the ward-level upwards to the district , panchayat union , town and city units , could at best hold one post in any Government or related organisation .
While this ` ` bold move' ' by the DMK would take care of the long- standing loyalties of the senior partymen at the District and Panchayat Union levels - where the multiple posts problem is acute - sources said the decision would also help spread the other official slots more evenly amongst the cadres , who resented ` ` domination' ' of most official posts by a single individual .
` ` The cadres will be happy' ' as more partymen , who were not holding party posts , would get an opportunity to man official or related posts , sources said , adding , in one case the party 's top leadership discovered that a district functionary was holding on to as many as eight other non-party posts .
