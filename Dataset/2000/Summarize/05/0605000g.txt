The guiding principle

Human beings are emotional : in order to capture and capitalise on the emotional energy of a company , the mission needs to furnish a moral or philosophical platform for behaviour to run alongside its commercial criterion .
Thus , we understand that purpose , strategy , behaviour standards , and values constitute the four components of a mission : a strong mission will permeate in a company , where these four constituents flourish and reinforce each other .
There are many managers who are in intellectual agreement with the company 's purpose and strategy ; but that does not per se translate into an emotional involvement ; to that extent the implementation of a strategic plan will suffer default .
It is only when the individual identifies himself with the framework of values and behaviour norms in a company , that is when his emotional commitment comes to pass , it is , then strategy will turn into a mission .
The benefits are derived from two sources : from the clarity of direction which flows and follows as a consequence , when you define a mission ; secondly , from the collective commitment , loyalty , and zeal emanating from the individuals who are injected with the spirit of mission .
It will take further time to align the company 's values with the values of its employees.Converting a company to a new mission is akin to converting a community to a new religion .
