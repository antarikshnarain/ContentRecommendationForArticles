Satyam Infoway looks at organisational recast

Satyam Infoway Ltd. is contemplating to commission the services of the well-known global consultancy firm - McKinsey - to undertake a thorough review of the company 's growth strategy and suggest a suitable organisational structure accordingly .
The need for external help to take a dispassionate look at the working of Satyam Infoway has become quite imperative now that the company has become highly visible following the conclusion of the biggest acquisition yet by an information technology company in India when it took over a little-known India World Communications Private Ltd. in a cash all deal at the fag end of last year .
The consultant will primarily be asked to recommend an organisational structure even while suggesting the right growth strategy for the country 's first private sector Internet service provider .
Sources , nevertheless , have made it clear that Satyam Infoway 's focus will continue to be on five stated areas - corporate connectivity ( including B2B ) , Internet , portals ( including B2C ) , web services and Cyber caffe .
Once a COO is inducted , Mr. R. Ramaraj , Managing Director , is likely to relieve himself of the daily operational aspects of the company and exclusively focus on strategy planning and clearing policy cobwebs relating to the businesses in which Satyam Infoway operates .
While they bring in their skills , the company would assist them with the soft and hard infrastructure and marketing support which gives the service provider valuable time to devote to quality , speed of delivery and price of their services .
