Lavish praise pours in for Laxman

` ` I would like to dedicate this hundred to my uncle Baba Krishna Mohan , my parents , my brother , my coaches and all my well-wishers for encouraging me in my bad times. ` ` V.V.S .
He showed the rest of the team what happens when you spend some time in the middle. ` ` Kapil Dev patted Laxman .
In this time of disarray , to bat so positively and impressively was great. ` ` ''He showed it is not the power but timing which is so important to the art of batting , ` ` said Kapil .
Here , my captain advised me to just hang around and spend some more time at the wicket .
Then I was the highest run- getter for India and he was the highest wicket-taker for the Australian team .
It is always a great challenge facing him and I think throughout this tour , he has got me out three-four times .
