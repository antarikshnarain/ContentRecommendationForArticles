Talk of the town 

IS THE TMC leader Mr. Moopanar consciously setting for himself a healthy conduct- rule that will break the traditional apathy political leaders in the State show towards their rivals ?
While party workers and leaders believe that even sharing a common platform with rivals amounts to ` ` anti-party' ' activity , Mr. Moopanar shared some joyous moments of religious significance with AIADMK General Secretary , Ms. Jayalalitha at an Iftar Party organised by the latter on December 26 .
The next day , Mr. Moopanar said he felt as if he got some extra energy from this experience.Interestingly , during the same period , Mr. V. R. Nedunchezhian , AIADMK leader , and Mr. Ramadoss , PMK leader , had declined invitations for the Kanyakumari function on flimsy grounds .
In the latest incident , a senior IAS officer transferred an Assistant Commissioner in the city who was not found effective in curtailing the diversion of PDS stock in his division .
* * * IF ONE believes that in politics , a leader has to always favour his men , there can be exceptions .
Two DMK councillors who went by ` ` conventional wisdow' ' had to rub their eyes in disbelief , recently , when the Mayor Mr. M. K. Stalin cancelled two tenders awarded to their acolytes .
