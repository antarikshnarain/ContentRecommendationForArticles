Ceilings raised for cotton yarn exports

The new ceilings on export of cotton yarn of 40s and below counts have been fixed at 500 million kg and that for hank yarn of below 60s at 20 million kg .
The 100 per cent export oriented units and export promotion zone units will continue to enjoy exemption from the ceiling for export of cotton yarn of 40s and below counts without any count or domestic cotton use restrictions .
Also in the exempt category will be exports made under the advance licensing scheme or on the basis of cotton imported under the open general licence ( OGL ) or by the export promotion capital goods units .
The rising trends in the exports of cotton yarn in 1999 further enthused the Government to revise the ceiling on exports of cotton yarn .
According to the Ministry , the ceiling has been revised in such a way that it would ensure adequate supplies of cotton yarn to the decentralised handloom and powerloom sectors at reasonable prices , besides maintaining continuity in cotton yarn exports without affecting competitiveness of higher value added cotton fabrics , made-ups and garment exports .
