Wallowing in tradition

Sir , - Ms. Subhashini Ali 's article ` ` Outlawing inhuman practices' ' ( TheHindu , Dec. 27 and 28 ) is an excellent rebuttal to Ms. Madhu Kishwar 's Hindutva perspective of the unfortunate incidents at Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh .
I only wish that Ms. Ali had not jumped to the conclusion absolving the family of Charan Shah , who immolated herself on the funeral pyre of her husband , of any wrongdoing .
Why ca n't we become worshippers of ` ` rational thinking' ' rather than of ` ` our traditions' ' or ` ` our heritage' ' , which in most cases include a lot of irrationality .
