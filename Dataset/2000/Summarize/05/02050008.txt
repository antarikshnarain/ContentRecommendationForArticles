BJP ahead in Gujarat local polls 

In 347 seats , of the total 1,641 , results for which have been declared so far , the BJP has bagged 180 with the Congress ( I ) trailing behind with only 43 .
The BJP State general secretary , Mr. Gordhan Jhadafiya , claimed that the party had already bagged 314 of the 502 seats , results of which had been declared locally .
While the Election Office maintained that results of none of the 50 municipalities were available , the BJP claimed to have already secured the Dehgam , Mandvi , Navsari , Gondal and Limbdi municipalities while the Congress ( I ) claimed to have won the Vapi , Junagadh and Amreli municipalities .
Mr. Jhadafiya said going by the early trend , the BJP was certain to capture at least 35 municipalities on its own and establish control on another five to 10 local bodies with the support of the independents sponsored by the party .
Even in Mehsana district , where the party fared well in the last Lok Sabha elections winning both the parliamentary seats much against the general trend in the State , the party was receiving serious drubbing in the municipal elections trailing the BJP in Mehsana , Visnagar , Kadi , Kalol and other municipalities in the district .
