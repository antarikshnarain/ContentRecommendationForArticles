The programme for the millennium

According to the projections made in the 15th Electric Power Survey , the energy and peak demand are likely to increase to 596 billion kWhr and 95,750 MW respectively by the end of the Ninth Plan ( 2001-02 ) and 1,058 billion kWhr and 176,647 MW respectively by 2011-12 .
While coal based stations will continue to play a major role for many years to come , they are likely to pose serious problems in future arising out of transport of large quantities of coal across the country and environmental problems related to disposal of ash and emission of greenhouse gases and acid gases .
A few examples are : RAPS-1 ( Rajasthan ) south end-shield repair ; MAPS-1 & 2 ( Kalpakkam ) Calandria inlet manifold management ; repair of over-pressure relief device of RAPS-I ; rehabilitation of an adjuster assembly at RAPS-2 ; RAPS-1 and MAPS steam generator hair-pin removal ; single pressure tube removal in NAPS-I ( Narora ) ; en-masse removal and replacement of coolant channels at RAPS-2 ; development of a system called BARCIS to carry out in-service inspection of coolant channels ; development of a system to relocate garter springs in coolant channels which have been displaced from their positions and so on .
Fast breeder reactors The second stage envisages setting up of fast breeder reactors ( FBRs ) backed by reprocessing plants and plutonium-based fuel fabrication plants .
It has provided valuable experience with liquid metal fast breeder reactor technology and the confidence to embark upon the design and technology development of a 500 MW prototype fast breeder reactor ( PFBR ) .
It involves determination of reactor physics parameters for U-Th system , separation of U from irradiated thorium , manufacturing of U based fuel containing small quantities of U having hard gamma emitting daughter products and establishing fuel specifications amenable to reprocessing .
