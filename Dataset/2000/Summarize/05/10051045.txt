dated January 5, 1950: The Kashmir deadlock

Gen . McNaughton , who had been playing the role of mediator , had been a member of the Council , and had won for himself a good name and could even claim credit for helping to break the deadlock over Indonesia .
India , in the amendments she had proposed to his plan , had stuck to her guns and had not budged a single inch from the positions she had all along taken and any further mediation Gen. McNaughton might make on the basis of the published plan was bound to result in failure .
So , it was also felt that the Council might well adopt a policy of drift as was done in the case of Palestine , allow the deadlock to continue , seeing to it , of course , that there was no loss of ground already gained and no renewal of shooting in Kashmir .
