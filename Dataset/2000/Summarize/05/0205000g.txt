Delay in settling insurance claims 'deficiency in service'

The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has upheld the findings of a consumer court that a delay in settling claims by insurance companies will come within the ambit of Consumer Protection ( CP ) Act .
The Commission also upheld that by not paying the amount due to the complainant , the insurance company had committed ` deficiency in service' .
This finding comes close on the heels of a recent Supreme Court ruling , bringing the services of the offices of the Regional Provident Fund Commissioners within the purview of the CP Act .
According to the facts of the case , a transport company in Maharashtra had insured its vehicle with an insurance company and the vehicle met with an accident .
The Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum , Amravati held that the complainant had not committed any breach nor had there been any negligence on the part of the driver of the complainant .
On appeal by the insurance company , the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held that the ` deficiency in service ' of the company was proved and the order of the Forum needed no interference .
