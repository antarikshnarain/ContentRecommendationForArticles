Maharashtra plans to improve policing

A communication network using satellites and computers to link all police stations , bifurcating law and order and crime investigation responsibilities right up to that level , amending laws to ensure that in cases of eveteasing no bail is granted unless two respectable women offer sureties are some of the provisions on the cards to improve policing .
A committee , comprising two Ministers of State for Home , Mr . Manikrao Thakre and Mr. Kripashanker Singh , a DGP , Mr. Arvind Inamdar , and six other key officials , is developing these features .
This committee , of which Mr. Thakre is the chairman and Mr. Singh the co-chairman , is looking at issues that dog police force in general and personnel in particular but while it is able to look at what can be done to prop up morale , provide promotional avenues and reshape the working , the crucial aspect of how to peg required levels of efficiency and means to monitor them effectively seems to have been given a lower priority .
The intent to separate law and order management and the crime investigation parts of police work is to ensure greater focus on crime probe in all areas except Mumbai - that commissionerate alone has a separate anti-crime wing - by eliminating other distractions .
