Bungling that proved costly 

The release of Maulana Masood Azhar , Mustaq Zargar and Syed Ahmed Umar Sheikh , represents a surrender by the Vajpayee Government in its fight against extremism in the Kashmir valley .
It is not for us to spell out the methods of doing so - but as various analysts have indicated during the course of the last several days - such a situation could have been created enabling us to detain the aircraft at Amritsar .
The hijacking and subsequent release of three hardcore extremists is part of the overall plan drawn up at the behest of the Pakistani ruling establishment to intensify extremist activity in the Kashmir valley .
Knowing fully well that Nepal is a hotbed for ISI-sponsored extremist groups ' operations , the India needs to take more precautions and have its own mechanism for conducting security checks on passengers boarding Indian Airlines flights from Kathmandu .
Mr. Jaswant Singh could have been trusted to accomplish this given his close rapport with the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State , Mr. Strobe Talbott , or the U.S. Secretary of State , Ms. Madeleine Albright , after all his talks shrouded in secrecy over the CTBT .
Even after the deal was struck in the morning and Mr. Jaswant Singh was to leave for Kandahar in the comfortable company of the released militants , the Prime Minister informed me at 2 p.m. that the hijackers had scaled down their demands and that he was sending Mr. Singh to Kandahar for further talks .
