Cullinan, Kallis put S. Africa in command 

The temperatures soared to 35 degrees Celsius but even when Daryll Cullinan pushed a short single for his five hour century the English fielders were still trotting briskly about their work and the only blemish was a drop at square leg by the 12th man Darren Maddy when Cullinan was on 89 .
South Africa began at 200 for one , a score that ensures anyone a peaceful night , but Silverwood 's third ball of the day drew Gary Kirsten into a forward shot outside the off stump and gave Alec Stewart a simple catch .
Hansie Cronje , who has not yet reached fifty in the series - and whose head has been demanded by some critics - was out for nought when he steered a rising ball from Andrew Caddick into the gully to give Michael Vaughan , an alert fielder , another catch .
Silverwood 's Yorkshire teammate Darren Gough burst through an appalling cross batted shot by Lance Klusener and at 307 , Shaun Pollock was snapped up by Adams in the slips off Caddick .
As Pollock trudged off it looked as if England had fought its way back into this match but , Daryll Cullinan , already clearly on his way to a century , and Mark Boucher , who might have been out half a dozen times for all he knew where the ball was , eased the score to 342 at tea .
The decisive blow came at 367 when Maddy , substituting for Andrew Flintoff dropped a hard hook shot by Cullinan on 89 at square leg off Gough .
