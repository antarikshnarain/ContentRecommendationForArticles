Railway finances

Though an increase in passenger and freight tariffs at least in alternate years has now become a routine , this has only sufficed to account for inflation and to partially meet the rising cost of inputs .
As the system continues to subsidise the movement of essential commodities and the maintenance of uneconomic lines or routes , any decline in freight revenue hurts the finances even more .
They would obviously prefer an enhanced budgetary support from the Centre to the Railway Ministry , as the percentage of Central contribution to the Railways had dipped steeply through successive plan periods .
For instance , in her supplementary estimates , Ms. Banerjee has offered special concessions to the unorganised sector for traders , farmers and vendors earning less than Rs .
If the Ministers now handling the Railways really want to nurse its finances back to health , they must announce a freeze on new projects and recruitment , no more feasibility studies till the backlog is cleared , no introduction of new trains and a panel to streamline existing services so that there are no unnecessary services in sectors where the occupancy remains below 40 per cent ( unless there are no other means of transport there ) .
An independent authority must be set up to prescribe and periodically revise the tariffs so that the Railways can gradually win back its legitimate share of passenger and goods traffic and also increase its revenues .
