'Masood can come to Pak.' 

Masood Azhar , a Harkat-ul-Mujahideen cleric who regularly propagated global ` ` jehad' ' , can return home if his Pakistani identity is established , a Pakistan military spokesman has said .
He has not committed any offence,' ' Brigadier Rashid Qureshi , chief of the Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) Directorate , was quoted as saying in Karachi on Monday .
` ` The Indian Premier 's statement also points to a preconcieved objective of building a strategic relationship with the United States on trumped-up charges of terrorism against Pakistan,' ' Mr . Sattar was quoted as telling the official APP news agency .
` ` In doing so , India no doubt wants world opinion to ignore India 's abhorrent record of state terrorism,' ' Mr. Sattar said .
