No benefits in not signing CTBT: Pak. 

Pakistan continues building its domestic case for an early signature on the CTBT , a move it believes could take some pressure off it from donor-countries and , simultaneously , lend greater legitimacy to the military regime of Gen. Pervez Musharraf .
Addressing a seminar at the Institute of Policy Studies , the Foreign Minister , Mr. Abdul Sattar , said today : ` ` Not signing the Treaty has identifiable costs , but not benefits .
Admitting that the prospects of the CTBT entering into force had become ` ` uncertain' ' after the U.S. Senate rejected the Treaty , Mr. Sattar said : ` ` It does not matter which state signs first and which last .
If a state ( read Pakistan ) discovers it is the target of discrimination , that would be an eminently good reason to refuse ratification,' ' he said .
At the outset , the Foreign Minister said : ` ` when Pakistan had been the target of vicious Indian propaganda , motivated by a preconceived design to falsely implicate Pakistan in the Indian plane hijacking incident , it might seem odd to speak about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
Our Government acted in accordance with law and humanitarian norms....the Indian Government decided to build up artificial tension , illustrating once again its animus and hostility to Pakistan .
