Zero tolerance & terrorism 

THE PRIME Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee , may or may not be firmly in the saddle yet , but his National Democratic Alliance has made one significant declaration : that its Government would be guided by the principle of zero tolerance in its fight against terrorism .
' ' The Union Government 's declaration that it would pursue a policy of zero tolerance while combating terrorism can have a deep impact in a geo-strategic region like the north-east , large parts of which are reeling under insurgency with the separatist rebels operating from both within and outside the country 's borders .
India , in keeping with its democratic spirit , has held dialogue with outlawed insurgent groups such as the Mizo National Front and the Tripura National Volunteers and is now engaged in talks with the Isaac-Muivah faction of the banned National Socialist Council of Nagaland .
Talking about double-speak , the Home Minister , Mr. L. K. Advani , said , while participating recently in a special discussion in the Lok Sabha on internal security , with special reference to J&K ; and the north-east , that the Government was in favour of ending militancy in the country through negotiations within the Constitutional framework .
This being the case , there is no point in talking of zero tolerance because one can not even remotely think of a military solution to insurgency in the north-east , in the same way as the rebels can not or should not hope to achieve a military victory over Indian forces some day .
Coinage of a phrase like zero tolerance policy may be wrong but the Prime Minister 's latest move to meet with the Chief Ministers and Governors of the north-eastern States in Shillong on January 21 to address the twin and most crucial issues of insurgency and development is praiseworthy .
