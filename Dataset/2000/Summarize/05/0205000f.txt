NHRC writes to CMs and CJs on prison reforms

In his letter to the Chief Justices , he has asked them to give appropriate instructions to District and Sessions Judges ( DSJs ) to take necessary steps to resolve the acute problem of over crowding in prisons and long pendency of cases .
Mr. Justice Verma has therefore recommended that the DSJs during their visits , could look into serious problems and ensure prison administration and speedy trials , as these problems had an impact of violating a human right which was given the status of Constitutional guarantee .
In his letter to the Chief Ministers , Mr. Justice Verma observed that in spite of Human Rights Cells set up in various police headquarters , ` ` there has not been any significant decline in genuine complaints of human rights violations committed by the police .
Mr. Justice Verma has also drawn the attention of the Chairpersons of State Human Rights Commission to rededicate themselves for the uplift of the common man and for developing a human rights culture in every sphere of life and instruments of governance .
