Feud in TNCC(I) may intensify 

With the decision of the Congress ( I ) high command to postpone the deadline for membership enrolment to January 31 , the internecine feud in the Tamil Nadu unit of the party is likely to gather momentum .
Mr. Sankaranarayanan , however , has reminded them that retention or change of the State unit leadership was the prerogative of the party high command and his primary concern was to complete the organisational elections in the State as per the AICC ( I ) schedule .
Some of the leaders are meeting in groups formulating their plan of action against the TNCC ( I ) chief while the official set-up led by Mr. Ramamurthy is doing everything at its command to create an impression that this group enjoys a broader support base .
Mr. Sankaranarayanan has been camping in Chennai since yesterday holding further discussions with party leaders , including Mr . Ramamurthy , on the appointment of district election officers and reviewing the pace of membership enrolment .
Some excitement and commotion are likely to be witnessed in the TNCC ( I ) and also the Pondicherry unit of the Congress ( I ) with the likely visit of Mr. Gulam Nabi Azad during the second week of this month .
Mr. Sankaranarayanan and Mr. Azad are planning joint sessions with local partymen to achieve the twin objective of completing the electoral process and ushering in unity among the faction leaders .
