Hijackers in Pak. military base?

According to a communication intercept on Monday night , the Pakistani military has instructed one of its forward locations that the five hijackers and three insurgents , which include Masood Azhar , Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and Ahmed Sayeed Omar Sheikh , be brought to its ` ` Zhob headquarters' ' after they crossed the Durand Line .
Inquiries here revealed that the Taliban played a key role in removing explosives placed in a ` ` blue and white' ' suitcase which only they recognised , apart from the hijackers .
Once this suitcase was removed , the pilot and crew , who stayed in the terminal of Kandahar airport the previous night , left the next morning and arrived in the capital before noon on New Year 's day .
While most of the hijackers stayed back in a Kathmandu hotel , one of the desperados , Ibrahim Mistry , armed with a revolver , crossed into the departure area after a ` ` security check'' .
They pointed out that Karachi had become a haven for underworld operatives , including Chotta Shakeel who might have shifted base from Dubai after India and the UAE signed an extradition treaty .
Investigations , after the arrest of four underworld operatives , have revealed that hijacking of a plane and causing explosions in Mumbai were part of a plan to be executed around New Year 's eve .
