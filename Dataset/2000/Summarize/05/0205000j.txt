Mysore Palace in the eye of controversy again

This follows the statement made by the Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister , Mr . D.B.Chandre Gowda , that the Government proposed to set up a trust to maintain and manage the historic palace .
The J.H.Patel Government circumvented a judgment of the Supreme Court , which upheld the right of ownership of Mr. Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wodeyar , the scion of the royal family of Mysore over the palace , by getting the Mysore Palace ( Acquisition and Transfer ) Act of 1998 passed by the legislature .
Mr. Wodeyar , a Congress ( I ) member of the Lok Sabha representing Mysore , challenged the Palace Acquisition Act in the court , which ordered the maintanence of status quo , till the final verdict was delivered .
S.M.Krishna Government 's new thinking of maintaining the palace like the world renowned Buckingham Palace , runs counter to the decision of the previous Janata Dal Government .
Mr. Siddaramaiah , who was the Deputy Chief Minister in the Patel Government , has accused the Krishna Government of trying to revive monarchy , by countermanding the Palace Acquisition Act which was adopted with a overwhelming majority by the legislature .
Meanwhile , the Government , which received a copy of the broad outlines of the administration of the Buckingham Palace is said to be examining how best the model could be adopted for the administration of the Mysore Palace .
