Gram Sabhas: Villagers take officials to task 

Gram sabhas in these parts have become tumultuous affairs , with vociferous villagers questioning the sarpanches and mandal level officers as to why they did not fulfil their promises for so long .
One reason for this is the presence of the CPI and the CPI ( M ) in these villages and the call given by these two parties to people to raise questions about the issues approved in earlier sabhas , and another is the fact that the gram sabha is being held after a gap of seven months , because the intervening Janmabhoomi was cancelled due to the election schedule .
Nirmala of the Telugu Desam , went on the offensive , shouting at people who raised the issue of the failure of a borewell : ` ` Am I expected to visit each and every house in the village everyday to find out whether you are getting water ?
' ' And after going into tantrums for ten minutes , she walked out in a huff from the gram sabha , leaving the field for the nodal officer , Mr. Suresh Babu , and her husband , Mr. Ch .
Mr . Gandu Sathyanarayana , who was an upa-sarpanch earlier , says that the sarpanch , and her husband , have ` ` cornered' ' all the funds the village gets , spending it in ` ` useless' ' works , such as laying drains where people do not benefit .
` ` No , I have my limit , and I have to function within the limit' ' , replies the Nodal Officer , Mr. Suresh Babu , an Assistant Director of Industries.For a change , it is the sarpanches and officials who are apprehensive at the gram sabha , while it is the people who ask questions .
