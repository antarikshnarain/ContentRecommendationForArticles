PM's call a diversionary tactic, says Opposition

NEW DELHI , JAN.4 Political parties today termed as a ` ` diversionary tactic' ' the Prime Minister , Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee 's statement that major powers should declare Pakistan a terrorist state .
` ` The Prime Minister 's statement is nothing but an attempt to get over the embarrassment on his government 's handling of the hijack crisis' ' , the marxist leader maintained .
The Congress ( I ) spokesman , Mr. Ajit Jogi , said that while his party supported the Prime Minister 's demand , it suspected that Mr. Vajpayee 's statement was aimed at diverting the nation 's attention from his Government 's failures on the hijacking episode .
The Congress ( I ) would like to know what preparations it had made to achieve this objective , since the Prime Minister of a nation did not just express an opinion .
Mr. Jogi said that when the Congress ( I ) was in power , it had asked that a special session of the UN General Assembly be convened to discuss terrorism ; the party had always maintained that Pakistan was encouraging terrorism in India and that there was enough evidence for this .
We are happy to note that he now realises the real intentions of Pakistan,' ' said the AICC spokesman , adding that the Congress ( I ) had no political motive and only the nation 's interest at heart .
