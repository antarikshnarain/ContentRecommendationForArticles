Opening the flood-gates

Some other gains expected of FDI in retailing are : Modernisation of retailing , prospects of reaping economies of scale and scope and give the Indian shoppers the taste of newer things such as convenience shopping , shopping under one roof and the benefit of proper quality control and grading .
Flush with financial surpluses , spurred by the oligopolistic-competitive urge to capture ever larger market share , fortified by a long inning of trading experience in many countries which helps reduce inventories , provide fresh avenues of sourcing , providing cushion against adverse conditions by prospects of offsetting losing areas against the expanding ones , it is not surprising that the retailing chains should try to explore newer pastures .
It is such predilections and fads which are probably inducing a government swearing , for form 's sake , by fierce nationalism both economic and cultural , but in effect , catering to the cravings of the crowds suffering from an identity crisis which may , at a more fundamental level , be inducing the bosses in the External Affairs Ministry to vociferously push the case for DFI in retail trade in India .
In a country with highly sluggish and woefully inadequate rate of growth of meaningful employment opportunities , retailing in various forms is easily the first component of the coping strategy adopted by the fast growing marginalised , socially-dispensable hordes of outcasts-ranging from the pavement vendors and peripatetic traders to street corner grocers , bakers and confectioners to various sales cum repair outlets .
Entry of FDI and modernised , large-scale retailing would make this highly competitive sector oligopolistic , reduce own-account work and income earning opportunities by ousting small , pavement , street-corner and peripatetic retailers and increase inequities , differentiation and resulting social tensions and unrest .
With impending opening up of the flood gates for the import of consumers goods , even India 's big and medium industries would find the pitch queered as these foreign chain stores would find it cheaper to push imported goods into Indian markets where there is a widespread special penchant for foreign goods .
