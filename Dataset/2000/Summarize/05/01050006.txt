Gujarat ban on staff joining RSS goes 

The BJP Government in Gujarat has amended the Gujarat Civil Servants Conduct Rules , lifting the ban on participation by Government employees in the activities of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh .
The Minister of State for Home , Mr. Haren Pandya , said that with the lifting of the ban , membership or volunteering to work for the RSS would no longer be treated as an act of indiscipline for these employees including police personnel .
The RSS as well as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad , the Hindu Mahasabha , the Anand Marg , the All-India Muslim Majlis-E- Mushawarat , the Sati Pati Creed and the Mass Movement ( Madhok faction ) were among the 30 or so organisations in the list of the Centre participation in which were banned for the State and the Central Government employees .
Under the Central list , State Government employees were accordingly restricted from having any connection with the RSS and such other banned organisations under the Gujarat Civil Servants Conduct Rules , 1971 .
If coloured by saffron and the RSS ideologues , the police may not be able to carry their duties impartially and the teachers may pass on the wrong ideology to the impressionable young minds,' ' a Home Department official commented .
Another former Chief Minister , Mr. Shankarsinh Waghela , himself a former RSS card holder who merged his Rashtriya Janata Party with the Congress ( I ) last year , saw in the Government 's decision the BJP 's ` ` real agenda'' .
