Clinton visit hinges on Pak. crackdown on militant outfits

The United States has identified the Harkat- ul-Mujahideen ( HUM ) as being responsible for the hijack of the Indian Airlines aircraft and has called upon the Musharraf regime to take strong action against the outfit , among other groups .
Informed sources told The Hindu that during his two-hour-long meeting with the Pakistani Chief Executive , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , on Friday , the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State , Mr . Karl Inderfurth , linked the visit of the U. S. President , Mr . Bill Clinton , to Islamabad , with strong Pakistani action against terrorist groups .
Mr. Inderfurth , who repeatedly raised the hijacking- terrorism issue during his discussions , told Gen. Musharraf that a ` ` positive' ' decision on Mr. Clinton 's visit was possible if his Government launched a ` ` crackdown' ' on the ` ` jehadi groups'' .
According to the sources , Gen. Musharraf told Mr. Inderfurth that ` ` immediate action' ' against the groups may not be possible , but indicated that such a move may be possible in the next few months .
