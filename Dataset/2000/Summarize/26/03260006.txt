All hostages freed in pre-dawn swoop 

There were no indications of injuries to any of the hostages as a direct result of the commando assault , though at least one Thai military official was hurt in the operation against the group , a splinter faction of the Karen National Union fighting the military government in Myanmar .
As details of the successful operation were announced by Thailand 's Prime Minister , Mr. Chuan Leekpai , its military and civilian officials , it won the appreciation of the Yangon regime , which had been cross with him for the handling of the seizure of the Myanmarese embassy in Bangkok last October .
On that occasion , the hostages were freed only after the gunmen , belonging to a Myanmarese pro-democracy student faction , were allowed a safe passage out of Thailand , with the Thai Deputy Foreign Minister , Mr. Sukhumbhand Paribatra , acting both as their escort and their prize proxy-hostage .
In contrast , a point of much significance to Yangon was that the Thai authorities succeeded in killing the hostage-takers who belonged to a group that had given shelter to those involved in the earlier seizure of the Myanmarese embassy in Bangkok .
It is understood that the primary political consideration was that the hospital could not be equated with the Myanmarese embassy which by definition was not treated as Thailand 's territory for purpose of a commando-style rescue- operation .
' ' The Thai authorities initially placed a high premium on the safety of the hostages , with the Army Chief , Gen. Surayudh Chulanont , saying that an attempt would be made to ` ` negotiate' ' with the gunmen by ` ` focusing on the safety of the hostages .
