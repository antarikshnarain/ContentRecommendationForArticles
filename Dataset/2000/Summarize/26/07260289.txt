Central spoils North's party 

Central Zone , which had failed to defend a total of 300-plus against East last week , survived some anxious moments while chasing 238 today , after its bowlers had done enough in the morning to restrict North Zone 's formidable batting line-up .
It took a nugget of an innings from Devendra Bundela ( 45 , 52b , 5x4 ) , who came in at 138 for three in the 31st over after Khurasiya had smacked a six and a four in two balls and then threw his wicket to Robin Singh .
