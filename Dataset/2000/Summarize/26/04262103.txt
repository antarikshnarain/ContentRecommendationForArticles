Gram panchayat polls: 3 Cong. MLAs oppose Ghorpade's decision 

A storm is brewing in the ruling Congress ( I ) with three MLAs strongly opposing the decision taken by the Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj , Mr. M. Y . Ghorpade , to hold the gram panchayat elections next month without changing the roster system of reservation adopted by the previous Janata Dal Government .
The roster prepared under the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act of 1993 had made reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes , Scheduled Tribes , Backward Classes A and B categories and the general category .
They have alleged that though he was aware of the intention of the Dal Government , Mr. Ghorpade had stubbornly resisted pressures from his Ministerial colleagues and party MLAs and taken a hasty decision on holding elections .
The MLAs have gone further to say that there was no need at all to have a Cabinet Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj to implement the roster system adopted by the previous Government .
' ' They have gone to the extent of warning Mr. Ghorpade that he might have to pay a heavy price , say by way of giving up his ministership , once the gram panchayat election results were announced .
It might be recalled that one or two of his Cabinet colleagues had taken exception to his remark at a press conference that he would not hesitate to resign if the gram panchayat elections were not held at the earliest .
