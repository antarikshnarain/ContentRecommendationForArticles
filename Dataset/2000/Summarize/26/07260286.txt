At last, the fragrance of victory 

After a long time India won a match in the Carlton & United Series thanks to Sourav Ganguly 's single- handed effort .
This will surely rank high in Ganguly 's list of centuries as he played a long innings and almost batted the entire 50 overs while keeping the run-rate ticking .
Ganguly has been in fine form in the series , and only he and Tendulkar have shown that they have the ability to carry the fight to the rival camp .
Ganguly 's hundred had more significance as he got his runs knowing about the weak middle-order and the must-win situation .
I would rate this as Ganguly 's best effort since it came against a sharp attack , and at a time when India needed it most .
The Indian bowlers came up with a spirited performance and what really mattered was the initial dent when Shahid Afridi and Saeed Anwar were removed .
