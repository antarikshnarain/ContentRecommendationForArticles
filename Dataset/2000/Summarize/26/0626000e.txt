Govt. needs to take bold steps

Second , given that the performance of the agricultural sector is more or less exogenous in the short and the medium run and , that the services sector has its own momentum of growth , it is the rate of growth of the industrial sector which is a better measure of the pulse of the economy , than that of the overall GDP .
But with agricultural growth nosediving to minus 5.6 per cent in 1997-98 and industrial growth of only about 6.6 per cent the overall GDP growth declined to 5 per cent .
Inflation measured by WPI showed some deceleration from about 8 per cent in 1995-96 to about 6.5 per cent in 1996-97 and 4.8 per cent in 1997-98 .
Fortunately the rate of inflation measured by the consumer price index does not deviate from the WPI rate by as much as it has in the past , The implicit GDP deflator also follows closely the movements in WPI .
According to the RBI data set the current account deficit , which is estimated to have been at $ 6.7 billion in 1998-99 rises to $ 7.2 billion in 1999-2000 and then decreases moderately to $ 6.4 billion in 2000-01 .
That the rate of growth of this variable in real terms goes beyond 7 per cent over the next two years will surely add to the imbalances in so far as deficit is more likely to be due to current expenditures rather than public investment .
