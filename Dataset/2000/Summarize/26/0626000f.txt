Personal advertising for job search

Though application blank serves as a source of information about job applicants as to their background , education , work experience , previous salary , and so forth , a more effective and innovative means of advertising a job applicant is through a ` resume ' which is now becoming an essential and expected part of virtually any job search .
These cover letters and resumes submitted by the job applicants are neither fish , fresh nor good red herring which the employers are unable to understand either head or tail of what do the applicants want and why !
Identification - name , address , phone number ; career or job objective ( to obtain a position as a... ) ; a personal qualifications ; education ; course concentrations ; employment experience ; activities ; interests and/or hobbies ( when relevant to the job ) ; published papers or articles and references .
Interestingly enough , resumes could be created on computer Microsoft word that are tailored to the applicant 's preferences , namely professional resume , elegant resume , resume wizard and contemporary resume .
What is more , the applicant can choose any of the following types namely , entry level resume , chronological resume , functional resume and professional resume for writing a clear , concised document to reflect his/her best self .
As a screening device , many employers would like to read a cover letter which must be clear , neat , brief , organised and above all is written with sense for as much as they will probably have a large number of cover letters together with resumes to review and any awkwardly formatted documents will obviously end up in a dustbin !
