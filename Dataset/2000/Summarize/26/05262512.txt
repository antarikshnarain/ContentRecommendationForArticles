Doubts over anti-missile system

THE FAILURE OF its Anti-Ballistic Missile System ( ABM ) to hit a speeding warhead high over the Pacific Ocean should have its lessons for the U.S. Defence Department which might have presumed that such a test was wholly routine and it would not have had any doubts about its being successful .
The Pentagon should be aware of the complexities thrown up by a missile system having to depend upon ground-based rather than space-borne systems and which should prepare those entrusted with their operations for a high failure rate .
Maj. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill , Acting Director of U.S. Strategic Defence Initiative Organization , while addressing an armed services sub-committee of the U.S. Senate a few years ago , laid the emphasis squarely on the acquisition of improved ground-based missile defence .
The failure of the latest missile launch could suggest that the ground-based systems have not acquired the perfection which should be built into it every time - which implies that the performance of a widespread network of vendors to whom orders for crucial components are farmed out is not wholly error-free .
The ABM missile system merits attention for the technology headway which the U.S. has made for ensuring that it stays ahead with the massive destructive capabilities it has built up to be prepared for the wars it feels called upon to wage in the future .
If it gives out a warning that a certain percentage of such weapons in stock , however small , is likely to fail , the U.S. could decide on build- up of a stockpile large enough to ensure that nothing is left to chance when a contingency perceived by the Pentagon as requiring their deployment arises in future .
