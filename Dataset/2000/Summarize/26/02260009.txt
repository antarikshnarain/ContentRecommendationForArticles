Wranglings, scuffle in NDA 

The seat-sharing agreement among partners of the National Democratic Alliance for the Bihar Assembly elections is threatening to fall apart with the parties unable to divide between themselves even the 108 seats which go to polls in the first phase on February 12 .
Till last night , the progress in the talks to decide on the 108 seats , which was held at the residence of the Union Finance Minister , Mr. Yashwant Sinha , was so slow that after several rounds an agreement was reached only on 70-odd seats , and not before a scuffle broke out between representatives of the Bihar People 's Party and the Samata Party .
The Samata Party , which wanted to contest some 130 seats , is now trying to make do with 90 , the BPP wanted 40 but was given 20 , the Janata Dal ( United ) wanted to contest as many seats as the Samata but its share was determined at 64 , while leaders of the BJP pointed out that they had ` ` sacrificed' ' the most , giving up 24 seats against a ` ` solid claim' ' on 174 ( based of the 1999 Lok Sabha seat-sharing agreement ) .
In a situation where unity was considered crucial to win the battle against the RJD , led by Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav , a limited NDA ` ` accord' ' could cost the partners dearly .
In Haryana , the BJP and the Indian National Lok Dal of Mr. Om Prakash Chautala may agree to accommodate the Akali Dal in a few seats which border Punjab and where there is a considerable presence of Sikhs .
