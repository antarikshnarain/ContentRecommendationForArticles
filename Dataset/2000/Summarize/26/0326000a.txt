Anwar alleges conspiracy

The trial had been adjourned on medical grounds , during which period the Prime Minister , Dr. Mahathir Mohamad , retained power convincingly in a general election despite the rise of Islamic fundamentalism as a political force .
Mr. Anwar is currently serving a six- year prison term , having been convicted and sentenced on April 14 last year on charges of having abused authority , while still in office , to stifle a police investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by him .
