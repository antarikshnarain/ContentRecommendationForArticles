HC dismisses plea of prisoner 

A writ petition filed by a prisoner facing death sentence , challenging a communication informing him that the President had rejected his mercy petition , has been dismissed by the Madras High Court .
Mr.Justice K. Govindarajan , who perused the official files on the mercy petition , held it was clear that the Executive had taken diligent steps on the mercy petition in the midst of other administrative functions and hence the petitioner 's case ( of delay ) could not be countenenced .
After his appeal in the Supreme Court failed , he submitted his mercy petition to the Tamil Nadu Governor and President on May 6 , 1998 .
Pointing to various Court decisions , Mr.Justice Govindarajan said the petitioner could not take advantage of the fact that his petition was disposed of after one year and five months .
The file was again submitted to the President on July 9 , 1999 ; on October 20 , 1999 , the President rejected the plea , which was communited to the State Government on October 27 .
As the President had passed the order after considering the entire materials and the advice given to him , ` ` this court is not inclined to accept the petitioner 's case and to interfere with the impugned order,' ' Mr.Justice Govindarajan said dismissing the writ petition .
