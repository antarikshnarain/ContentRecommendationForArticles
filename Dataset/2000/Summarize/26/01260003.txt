SC notice to Karnataka CM 

The Supreme Court today issued a showcause ` contempt ' notice to the Karnataka Chief Minister , Mr. S. M . Krishna , for certain statements attributed to him on ` ` the river Krishna water dispute - Alamatti dam matter' ' in a news report published on January 24 in an English daily .
Later , when Mr. F. S. Nariman , counsel , pleaded that the court 's order be suspended for the time being as it appeared that Mr . Krishna replied to a question on a related issue in a ` ` meet the Press programme' ' , the Bench said it had issued only a showcause notice to him ( to appear and explain his stand ) .
The Bench today began hearing the resumed arguments from Mr. F . S. Nariman , senior counsel for Karnataka , on its original suit which inter alia requested the court to direct the Centre to notify ` Scheme B ' - surplus water - framed by the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal and make provision for establishment of the Krishna Valley Authority and for implementation of the Tribunal 's directions in its 1973 report and 1976 Report , as contemplated under Section 6 ( A ) of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act .
