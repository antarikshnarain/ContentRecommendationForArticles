Engagement, not containment 

TO THOSE who view India-Pakistan relations as a zero- sum game , the fact that the world 's leading powers including the United States appear to view the present military regime in Islamabad with distinct disfavour and have begun to endorse New Delhi 's suspicions in regard to its sponsorship of terrorism in the region , is another feather in the cap for India 's diplomacy .
Such a reading of the regional situation which banks on the isolation of Pakistan in the global arena may yield short-term diplomatic satisfaction but in the long-run , this complacent approach would only put further pressure on the ground situation in the region and could also narrow India 's diplomatic and strategic options sharply .
That the sanctity of the Lahore Agreement , with its considerable promise of a substantive engagement on contentious issues such as the Kashmir dispute , as a predecessor document , the agreement of the two Foreign Secretaries in June 1997 had also entailed , was not upheld by the Musharraf-led regime , did lead to doubts in New Delhi as to the utility of contacts with Islamabad 's new leaders .
The recent spurt in terrorist activity in the Kashmir Valley and the traumatic episode of the hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu in late December which culminated in the Government having to capitulate to the demand to release three militants with links to terrorist organisations such as the Harkat-ul-Mujahadeen have been seen as clear evidence of Pakistan 's sponsorship of terrorism against India .
Not only does such an approach reduce India to a position of virtually abject dependence on the United States sharing its strategic view of the region , but it also constricts the diplomatic space within the region for India to make its own autonomous decisions in regard to relations with its own neighbours .
While there is no question that the Vajpayee administration will have to seek categorical and credible assurances from Pakistan that it will not support terrorist acts against the Indian state and people , it is important that such messages to Islamabad are delivered directly and not by relying on the global powers to endorse India 's position and thereby securing a worldwide indictment of Pakistan .
