Wearing of helmets: HC sets aside single judge's order 

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday set aside a single judge 's verdict directing the State Government and the Director General of Police ( DGP ) to implement strictly Sec .
129 of the Motor Vehicle Act , making wearing of helmets compulsory for two-wheeler riders and pillion riders .
The Bench comprising Dr. Justice A. R. Lakshmanan and Mr. Justice S. Sankarasubban quashed the single judge 's order on the ground that the State Government had not amended the Kerala Motor Vehicle rules which prescribed the specification of helmets , in response to the 1994 amendment made to Sec .
The Judges , however , made it clear that the dismissal of the writ petitions for the enforcement of the helmet rule ` will not stand in the way of the Government in enforcing the standards prescribed by the BIS as envisaged under Sec .
Allowing the writ appeal filed by the Kerala Auto Two-Wheelers Association , Kochi , the judges said the respondents , including the DGP , had not brought to the notice of the single judge the amendment to the Act .
The court said that neither counsel for the petitioner nor counsel for the respondents was in a position to place before the Bench any material with regard to the standards prescribed by the BIS for helmets .
