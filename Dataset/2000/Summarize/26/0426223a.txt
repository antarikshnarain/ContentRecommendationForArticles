HC orders arrest of officer 

The Madras High Court has directed the Joint Director ( south Zone ) , CBI , to take steps to arrest a woman central excise officer , said to be involved in a narcotics trafficking case .
The Court gave the direction after observing that the officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau ( NCB ) were totally ineffective in executing a non-bailable warrant for her arrest ` ` for reasons best known to them'' .
When Mr.Paulsamy 's petition seeking to quash the proceedings under the complaint came up before Mr.Justice Dinakaran , the Special PP for NCB , Mr. Rajamanickam , contended that she was attempting to tamper with the witnesses and evading arrest .
Mr. Justice Dinakaran said the NCB appeared not to have taken effective steps till date to either cancel Mr Paulsamy 's bail , nor execute the NBW against Ms.Lily .
Mr. Justice Dinakaran directed the Registry to call for an explanation from the Special Judge for NDPS cases , for not taking steps against the Bureau for their failure in executing the warrant .
