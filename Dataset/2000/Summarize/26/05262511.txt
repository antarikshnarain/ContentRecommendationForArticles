Threats to security 

Added to this serious exchange of fire , are the reports of several seizures in Delhi of explosives , timing devices and improvised explosive devices in the run-up to January 26 .
The security forces must maintain a constant vigil along the LoC and be in a position to repulse any attack from across the line .
Now that the Subrahmanyam committee report is with the Centre and the problems and failures in Kargil must have been analysed , the armed forces must plug the loopholes and evolve a coordinated strategy to repulse any attack or threat .
The seizure of ` ` explosive toys' ' , which were reportedly smuggled in the bus from Lahore , the arrest of suspected agents in Delhi along with RDX explosives and timing devices only confirms the fears that this whole operation will be a continuing affair .
A disaster was averted just half an hour ahead of the final dress rehearsal of the Republic Day parade , when the security forces unearthed a device planted in a plastic jar on the lawns of India Gate .
The people too have a duty - to remain alert and inform the authorities of any suspicious activities in their area , besides cooperating with the police in the security drill .
