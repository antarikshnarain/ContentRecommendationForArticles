In a ` ` suicidal attack' ' on the security forces , for which the pan- Islamic Harkat-ul-Mujahideen has claimed responsibility , at least two Army men were killed and six others injured in the Batamaloo area here last night .
A defence spokesman , confirming the incident , told mediapersons here that the militants fired four rifle grenades at the Army 's Tatoo Ground camp late last evening and followed it up with rocket launches which damaged some buildings .
This is the twelfth attack by the ` fidayeen ' of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba since July last in which a number of Army , BSF , CRPF and SOG personnel have been killed .

Srinagar , a ghost town The summer capital sports the look of a cantonment with joint columns of various security agencies dotting the Bakhshi Stadium area where the Republic Day parade is to take place .
Concrete bunkers with a three-ring security around the stadium have been erected to minimise the threat of the much- dreaded fidayeen squads of the Harkat and Lashkar .
