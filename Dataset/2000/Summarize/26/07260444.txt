Rivaldo, world's best player 

` ` Now I want to be European champion with Barcelona , then play in the 2002 World Cup and win that for Brazil,' ' the man with the explosive left foot told reporters after lifting the FIFA player of the year award on Monday night .
The poor boy from Brazil 's arid northeast has overcome the criticism that rained upon him after his team 's 1998 World Cup defeat and , at 27 , matured into an attacking midfielder who has it all - blistering pace , subtle ball control and a lethal goal- scoring instinct .
Coaches of 140 national teams overwhelmingly selected Rivaldo as the best in the game , ahead of Manchester United 's pinpoint pass master David Beckham and Fiorentina 's Argentine sharpshooter Gabriel Batistuta .
