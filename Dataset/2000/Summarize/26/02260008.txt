Constitution 50, resilient 

The major areas to be looked into are : Centre-State relations , Article 356 ( power of dismissal of a State government ) , the judiciary , to enable the setting up of a National Judicial Commission which will take care of appointments , transfer and removal of judges and electoral reforms .
The Constitution gives directions to the executive and the legislature to bear in mind certain principles aimed at reducing disparities and uplifting the weaker sections .
Of late , the general tendency among the people to litigate , the incidence of a large number of government cases , lawyers adopting a business-like approach and procedural delays have brought our judicial system under strain .
While judicial reforms point out that law colleges have mushroomed since independence , there has been a fall in the standards of legal education .
A new feature in the judiciary is provision of legal aid to the poor and weaker sections as part of the Directive Principles .
Lok Adalats have been given a statutory status and are being organised regularly throughout the country and a large number of cases have been settled .
