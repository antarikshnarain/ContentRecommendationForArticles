The Committee of Soldiers ' Mothers maintains that close to 3,000 soldiers had been killed in the campaign , while the private NTV television estimated that Russian losses in Chechnya are 10 times greater than the official figures .
An NTV report from a military hospital in the southern town of Rostov , where all killed personnel of the Defence Ministry are being sent from Chechnya , said the number of corpses reaches 30 a day and sometimes goes as high as 50 .
A source in the Russian headquarters in Chechnya told the AVN military news agency on Tuesday that federal forces would need 10 to 15 days at the minimum to take Grozny .
