Finance and development - which way now?

The end result of all these and other reforms has been the growing integration among various segments of financial markets. , closer convergence of Indian financial system with practices prevailing in international financial markets , and greater opportunity for investors to access both domestic and international markets .
Competitive condition in the banking industry has been facilitated by relaxing entry and exit norms and permitting the public sector banks to raise additional capital from the market ( up to a certain level ) .
After allowing for additional infusion of reserve capital through internal generation and access to subordinated debt , the gap between their additional capital requirement and the leeway available to raise capital from the market will still remain quite sizeable .
In this situation , an issue that needs to be debated and resolved is whether this gap should be filled by contribution from the RBI ( in the case of SBI ) and Government ( in the case of other public sector banks ) or whether legislative ceiling for capital to be subscribed by the public should be raised .
At the same time , it has to be recognised that in our situation , particularly in view of the need to give adequate attention to agricultural credit and rural banking as also to maintain public confidence in the safety of banks , the public sector character of these banks should not be given up .
Keeping these considerations in view , that is , those of allowing greater access to markets while at the same time maintaining the public sector character of banks presently owned by Government or the Reserve Bank , it may be necessary to prescribe a maximum ( at a suitably low level ) for shareholding by any single individual or a corporate in public sector banks .
