President cautions against social, economic disparities

On the eve of the Golden Jubilee of the Indian Republic , the President , Mr. K. R. Narayanan , has exhorted the nation to reinforce its democratic spirit , demanded a better deal for women , and warned against any attempt to roll back the reservation regime for the weaker sections of society .
Introducing an unconventional tone in his traditional address to the nation on the eve of the Republic Day , the President invited the citizens to undertake an ` ` honest self- analysis and self- questioning about where we , as a people and a society , are headed ?
Reminding the nation that ` ` Republic' ' means ` ` supreme power is exercised not by some remote monarch , but by the people' ' , Mr . Narayanan wanted the nation to use the occasion of the Golden Jubilee to ` ` hail that proclamation and commitment'' .
Drawing the country 's attention towards the phenomenon of ` ` sullen resentment among the masses against their condition , erupting often in violent forms in several parts of the country' ' , Mr. Narayanan cautioned that these voices of resentment should not go unheard .
In a candid indictment of the dominant economic policies , the President noted : ` ` Violence in society has bared a hundred fangs as advertisement-driven consumerism is unleashing frustrations and tensions in our society .
Coming down severely on the indifference towards the Dalits , the President noted that ` ` it seems , in the social realm , some kind of a counter-revolution is taking place in India' ' and that ` ` there are signs that our privileged classes are getting tired of the affirmative action provided by the Constitution provisions'' .
