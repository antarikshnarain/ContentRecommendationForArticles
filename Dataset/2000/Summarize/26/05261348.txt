Sombre thoughts on R-Day 

Having reported the inauguration of the republic half-a-century ago and followed its fortunes since then , I can recall only three occasions when Republic Day was celebrated amidst so much anxiety and concern as today , on its golden jubilee .
The worst stems from the manifest determination of Pakistan 's military regime , headed by General Pervez Musharraf , to up the ante in Kashmir and thus heighten tensions , on the one hand , and spread murder and mayhem in other parts of India , through a network of agents , on the other .
Mercifully , there is no inclination on the part of South Block to dismiss Gen. Musharraf 's threat of ` ` teaching a lesson' ' to this country as mere ranting of a military ruler in a hot seat .
To attack an Indian military post near Akhnoor ( whenever Pakistan rulers have been hell-bent on conflict they have headed for this highly strategic area ) , to blame this country for having crossed the LoC , and to call on the U.N. Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , to ` ` intervene' ' gives his game away .
But evidently he is convinced that the nuclear standoff in the subcontinent enables him to be as aggressive in Kashmir as he wants to be because India would not be in a position to retaliate for fear of any conflict escalating into a nuclear exchange .
But his remarks have been followed by a strident declaration by Mr. John Holum , honcho of America 's Arms Control and Disarmament set-up , that his country would ` ` strip India of nuclear weapons .
