Kobi Ziv crashes out 

Long rallies and predominantly baseline play featured the contest but in the end not only did Ziv lose the match , but lost grace too , shouting at the Chair Umpire on his way out , crashing a plastic bottle onto the side fencing before slamming a fist on the glass door at the entrance of the main building .
No damage was done but the show of anger seemed totally unwanted and surprisingly the whole thing was overlooked when for ` repeated questioning of the Chair Umpire ' another player , Vishal Uppal of India was given a code violation ( read warning ) .
Vijendra Laad came for Tom Spinks of Britain ( who did not report his unavailability to the Tournament Supervisor and hence faces a penalty of $ 250 ) and Anand Radhakrishnan for Jicham Zaatini ( Lib ) , who quit with a shoulder problem .
Apart from Laad and Radhakrishnan , the other Indians to go out were Vishal Uppal , Manoj Mahadevan , Mustafa Ghouse and Rishi Sridhar beasides the doubles pair of Kamala Kannan and Ravishankar .
