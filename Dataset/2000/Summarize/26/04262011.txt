Local body polls: Cong. keen on tie-up with Communists 

The issue figured at the extended meeting of the APCC ( I ) Executive Committee on Tuesday and it was resolved to leave it to the district units of the party to work out mutually beneficial adjustments with the CPI , the CPI ( M ) and other secular parties with the sole aim of defeating the TDP-BJP combine .
Briefing presspersons later , the APCC ( I ) president , Dr. Y. S . Rajasekhara Reddy , said that the electoral tie-up for the civic polls was discussed informally with the CPI leadership though no such discussions were held with the CPI ( M ) leadership .
Party sources said the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation held by the Communists figured specifically at the meeting and it was noted that the local leaders were not prepared to leave the Mayor post to the CPI under the formula of seat adjustments being explored by party leaders .
The PCC ( I ) Executive Committee opposed postponement of elections to the Panchayat Raj institutions on the ground that the necessary constitutional amendments to restore the three-tier structure of Panchayt Raj could not be carried out .
The PCC-I president urged the State Election Commission to ` ` oversee' ' the process of reservations and ensure that the notification was issued at least ten days before the notification on the elections , giving enough time for considering the objections .
Party leaders from Khammam district accused the district Collector , Mr. Giridhar , of acting in a partisan manner , ignoring representations from the Congress-I on weaker sections housing programme , CMEF and other developmental works .
