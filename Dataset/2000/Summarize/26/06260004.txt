SEBI allows net trading, clears corporate governance code

In two significant decisions , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) today allowed trading of shares through the Internet and set a deadline for companies to conform to norms for good corporate governance suggested by a committee headed by Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla .
The implementation in case of Internet trading regulations , corporate governance norms and FII investment would wait till the SEBI consults and seeks the approval of the Government , the Reserve Bank of India and the Department of Company Affairs ( DCA ) , added Mr. Mehta .
Two other major decisions taken by the SEBI board , which met here today , pertained to in-principle approval to certain measures aimed at promoting venture capital activity and permitted high net worth foreign individuals and corporates to invest in Indian stock markets .
A phased schedule has been drawn up for the corporate sector for implementing ` mandatory ' recommendations which include composition of the board of directors , appointment and structure of audit committees , remuneration of directors ' interest , shareholders rights and disclosers regarding compliance level of corporate governance in the annual report .
Foreign corporates and individuals have been allowed to invest in the capital market through registered FIIs provided the total investment does not exceed five per cent of the concerned company 's total capital within the aggregate limit of FII portfolio investment of 24 or 30 per cent , as the case may be .
On easing norms for venture capital funds , Mr. Mehta said the underlying philosophy was to cut down on the multiplicity of agencies which dissuade venture investors by recommending a nodal agency , designating venture capital funds as mutual funds , bringing them under the SEBI ambit and ensuring quick entry and exit from companies by speeding up routine tasks such as stock evaluation .
