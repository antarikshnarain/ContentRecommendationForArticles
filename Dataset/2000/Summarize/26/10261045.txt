dated January 26, 1950: Birth of a Republic

On the duties and responsibilities of every Indian , the day 's Editorial said : ` ` Every citizen must remember that if matters go wrong with the State it is he that is ultimately responsible .
And above all he must have the will to put his shoulder to the wheel and push and pull , never getting out of step with his fellows , never seeking short cuts , never succumbing to the temptation to find scapegoats.. . ` ` The Puranic legends of Creation speak of the Virat lying prone on the face of the waters , unresponsive to any of the lesser powers that entered , until at last the Supreme Spirit entered and forthwith the Virat moved .
It is that fire , that energy of life , that must be roused in the dormant consciousness of the people if India is to build up a fair , equitable and viable polity and a full life for her millions .
