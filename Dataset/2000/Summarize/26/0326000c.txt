Wahid holds talks with Aceh leaders

The Indonesian President , Mr. Abdurrahman Wahid , today sought to bring a healing touch to the Aceh province , the theatre of a separatist struggle , by travelling to the region and holding talks with the local authorities and representatives .
At another level , the Vice-President , Ms. Megawati Sukarnoputri , continued her peace mission to the riot-ravaged Spice Isles for a second straight day .
Overnight , her convoy was briefly held up at a point by some people affected by the communal carnage there , but there was no disruption of her visit itself .
