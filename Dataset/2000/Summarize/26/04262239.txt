AIADMK may contest all three seats 

With the TMC disinclined for an ` ` open alliance' ' with the AIADMK at this stage , the AIADMK-led front , at its meeting tomorrow , is expected to support the candidature of the AIADMK in all the three seats - Aranthangi , Tiruchi-II and Nellikuppam .
' ' When the seat negotiations for the Assembly by-polls became ticklish , the AIADMK got into a ` hard bargaining mode ' so as not to surrender its ` indisputably dominant partner status ' before the general election .
Three seats in an Assembly nearing the end of its term might not appear important , but the AIADMK wanted to use the seat negotiations as the basis for building a broad-based opposition front .
What the AIADMK general secretary , Ms. Jayalalitha , wants to demonstrate through a victory in the by-polls is that the people prefer the AIADMK front to the DMK front .
The Dalit Panthers of India , an ally of the TMC , was keen to enter the fray in Nellikuppam as a common candidate of the AIADMK and TMC fronts .
While the DPI convenor , Mr. R. Thirumavalavan , is confident about convincing his party members on the need to refrain from the contest , he is apprehensive about non-DPI Dalits who might switch support to the PT in the interest of Dalit consolidation .
