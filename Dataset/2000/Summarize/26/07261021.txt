Agassi and Sampras keep semifinal appointment 

As Mr. Inspiration and Miss Inspired led a Yankee procession into the semifinals of the year 's first Grand Slam championship on Australia Day eve here , today , expectations that the on-court fireworks over the next few days will match anything that can be seen in the skies above the beaches of Sydney or Melbourne on Wednesday may not really be misplaced .
But , then , the unpredictable and the unexpected are the very soul of sport and there has been nothing more soul- lifting this fortnight than Capriati 's unlikely surge to the semifinals of the Australian Open - nine long and difficult years after her last Grand Slam semifinal appearance , at age 15 , at the U.S. Open in 1991 .
Capriati , who handily beat Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-0 , 6-2 at the Rod Laver Arena , says that she was hugely inspired by what Agassi has accomplished in the most difficult and unlikely of his many comebacks last year when he won two of three Grand Slam finals in which he figured to end 1999 as the world champion .
And , quite predictably , they reached different destinations , too - Agassi ended up in his fourth straight Grand Slam semifinal while Arazi , beaten 6-4 , 6-4 , 6-2 , made his way to the Players 's Bank at Melbourne Park to pick up his cheque before checking on the flights out of Melbourne .
The results ( prefix denotes seedings ) : Men 's singles ( quarterfinals ) : 1- Andre Agassi ( U.S. ) bt Hicham Arazi ( Mor ) 6-4 , 6-4 , 6-2 ; 3-Pete Sampras ( U.S. ) bt Chris Woodruff ( U.S. ) 7-5 , 6-3 , 6-3 .
Women 's singles ( quarterfinals ) : 2-Lindsay Davenport ( U.S. ) bt 9- Julie Halard-Decugis ( Fra ) 6-1 , 6- 2 ; Jennifer Capriati ( U.S. ) bt Ai Sugiyama ( Jpn ) 6-0 , 6-2 .
