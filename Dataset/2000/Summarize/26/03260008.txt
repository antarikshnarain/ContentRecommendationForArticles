West Asia accord on final status likely 

Although negotiators from the two sides embarked on an intensive round of talks over the last week there is no sign that they have made progress on any one of the five major issues that have to be settled before a permanent settlement can be reached .
There were reports earlier this month that the Israeli Prime Minister , Mr. Ehud Barak , was contemplating a significant concession in respect of the Palestinians ' demand that they should have East Jerusalem as the capital of their state .
Given its location , its link-up with East Jerusalem would have been natural and the Palestinians would have been able to claim that Al Quds ( the Arab name for Jerusalem ) had indeed become their capital .
If these two transfers - of Abu Dis and of civilian affairs in East Jerusalem - had come to pass then the Palestinian demand on Jerusalem would have been substantially met though the question of authority over the Walled City would still have remained a controversial hold-over .
While the Palestinians do seem reconciled to some adjustments of the borders between the West Bank and Israel , which could include the permanent transfer of a large number of Jewish settlements and their lands to Israel , there is no sign that any headway has been made on the issues of settlements and borders .
So , although Mr. Arafat still insists that he has the right to declare statehood by September , Israel and probably the U.S. as well , will do their best to head him off till a comprehensive settlement has been reached .
