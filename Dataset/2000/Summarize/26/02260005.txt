Jaswant for joint action against terrorism

Asserting that India 's neighbourhood now provides the ` ` single largest gene-pool of terrorism' ' in the world , the External Affairs Minister , Mr. Jaswant Singh , today called for collective Asian action against the forces of extremism .
In his address to an international conference on Asian security here , Mr. Singh pointed to the rise of non-state actors ` ` fired by ideologies of extremism and fanaticism , and equipped with ever more lethal firepower'' .
Arguing that deepening of democracy was the critical imperative of Asian security , Mr. Singh said , ` ` narco-terrorism , extremism and small arms proliferation constitute the biggest threat to plural societies' ' in the region .
Pointing to the enormous diversity of economic and political systems as well as civilisations in Asia , the External Affairs Minister argued that stability in the region can not be built on the traditional notions of balance of power , but within a framework of ` ` cooperative security'' .
