Seat allotment: Tough going for parties 

Distribution of ticket for the first phase of elections in Bihar turned out to be a tough task for major political parties , indicating that things could be much worse as the deadline for the final two phases draws closer .
According to sources , the BJP has allotted symbols to 85 candidates , while 42 candidates of the Samata Party had submitted symbols along with their nomination papers .
Even if these parties decide on who should contest which seat , the delay threatens to give room for a fresh row and dispute in case some of the nominees decline to abide by their party 's decision .
While the supporters of two MLAs were up in arms , workers opposed to the other two MLAs who were fortunate to secure ticket gave vent to their ire .
Dr. Vijay Kumar Singh , the nephew of the former Chief Minister , Mr. S. N. Singh , whose daughter-in-law won from Aurangabad ticket as a Congress ( I ) nominee has decided to contest as an independent from Rafiganj .
Several senior leaders have been denied ticket while the CLP leader , Mr. Ramashray Prasad Singh , was heckled by a section of the crowd as he proceeded to fild his nomination from Konch .
