'Indian programmers were violating visa status'

The United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service ( INS ) has said that the Indian programmers , arrested and released on bond at the Randolph Air Force base near San Antonio on Thursday were working in ` ` violation of their non- immigrant visa status .
' ' The INS believed that the programmers were ` ` working in violation of their non-immigrant visa status,' ' Ms. Mariela Malero , regional spokeswoman for the INS in Dallas , Texas , said today .
That could be the potential for sanctions if we indeed found the company in violation ( of visa provisions ) .
Some 40 highly-qualified programmers , brought into the country by two Indian firms , Softech and Frontier , were arrested , handcuffed and paraded like common criminals for not carrying their valid H1-B visas on their person .
