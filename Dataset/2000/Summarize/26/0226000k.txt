Sabotage suspected in Rajdhani goof-up

The Northeast Frontier Railway today said there was a ` ` strong possibility' ' of sabotage in setting the Guwahati-bound Rajdhani Express on the down line on which the Delhi-bound Avadh-Assam Express was stationary , about 10 km away in north Bengal on Monday .
However , the railways clarified that while the Rajdhani Express was just leaving Kumedpur , the Avadh Assam Express was stationary at Khurial station , about 10 km away from Kumedpur .
The driver of the Rajdhani Express noticed the goof-up and since the train was at a slow speed , he could stop it within the limits of Kumedpur station , it said.Earlier in August last year , about over 280 passengers were killed and scores injured when the Avadh-Assam express and the Brahmaputra Mail collided after coming on same track at gaisal , near Malda in north Bengal .
