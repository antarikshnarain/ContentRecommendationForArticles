Cherish the delusion 

Sir , - ` ` India must trust me,' ' says Gen. Pervez Musharraf ( TheHindu , Jan. 17 ) .
The world sees him as an illegal usurper who back- stabbed the very man who made him the army chief out of turn .
Is it not a popular delusion to conclude that the unpopularity of the preceding ruler necessarily means popularity for the next one ?
The General is , of course , entitled to his own illusions and delusions about his ability to solve problems and lead nations to peace .
John Devanathan , Hyderabad * * * Sir,- Kudos to TheHindu for publishing the timely interview with Gen. Musharraf .
As what happened in the past can not be gone into and set right now , India should be more careful and highly diplomatic in its dealings with the neighbour to save the subcontinent from further Kargils and hijacks .
