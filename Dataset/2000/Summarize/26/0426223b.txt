TMC alleges 'irregularities' in purchase of water tanks 

The TMC has alleged irregularities in the Chennai Metrowater 's ( CMWSSB ) purchase of water tanks from a private company as also in the ` ` mineral water' ' project of CMWSSB .
On the purchase of plastic water tanks , he said the bids for 200 numbers of the tanks were floated last year and a decision was taken that two-thirds of the tanks would be procured from the lowest bidder and the rest from those who were willing to supply the tanks at the rates quoted by the lowest bidder .
According to the report , Mr.Balasubramaniam said , the weight of 3,000-litre- capacity tanks should be 96 kg but , in the case of the tanks supplied , it was 80 kg .
` ` This demonstrated clearly that the tanks were not upto the prescribed standards' ' , he said , wondering whether action had been taken against the supplier and those responsible for causing loss to Metrowater .
Referring to the recently launched ` ` mineral water' ' project , he said at a time when Chennai was reeling under water scarcity much before the arrival of summer , Metrowater had gone in for a scheme of selling packaged drinking water .
Contending that the drinking water position in and around Chennai had become precarious , he said the storage of the reservoirs feeding water to the city was poor and the Satyamurthi Sagar in Poondi , the principal source of supply , became dry .
