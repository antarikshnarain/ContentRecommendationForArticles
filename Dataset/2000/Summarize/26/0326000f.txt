Norwegian thrust to peace process

The visit of Mr. Leiv Lunde , Norway 's Secretary for Development Co-operation and Human Rights , is seen by Tamil political leaders as a preliminary step before a larger decision is taken on the Norwegian initiative to negotiate an end to the conflict .
Mr . Lunde , who spoke to members of the Ceylon Workers Congress ( CWC ) yesterday , is expected to meet leaders of other Tamil political parties as well as the island 's acting Foreign Minister , Mr . Lakshman Kiriella and the Opposition Leader , Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe .
The nature of the Norwegian initiative is yet to be defined , especially given the situation in which both the two main political parties , the ruling People 's Alliance ( PA ) coalition and the Opposition United National Party ( UNP ) , are opposed to a third-party mediator .
