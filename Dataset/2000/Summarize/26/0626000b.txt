The choice available in respect of rider benefits is quite wide - accident cover , critical illness cover , hospitalisation cover and , similar covers for the spouse and children .
They can not afford to cut the margins and reduce the premium rates since it would then take a longer time before they can match LIC 's bonus rates .
Since the entire profit under this class of business will accrue to the shareholders , the new entrants can afford to reduce their margins and correspondingly the premium rates .
So , the strategy of new entrants will be to concentrate on the designing of flexible , non-participating plans and shift the market focus from bonus rates to premium rates and operational efficiency .
Its shareholder , the Government , takes only 5 per cent of the profits emerging under the without profit ( that is , the non- participating ) portfolio whereas the shareholders of new entrants will take the full 100 per cent .
Will the new entrants concentrate only on non-participating policies and avoid confronting LIC under participating policies .
