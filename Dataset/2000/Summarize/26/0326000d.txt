CDU admits receiving slush funds

The main German Opposition party , the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , now deeply embroiled in the slush fund scandal , on Monday admitted hiding some 6 million euros received from anonymous donors between 1989 and 1999 , in the heydays of the then Chancellor , Mr. Helmet Kohl 's rule .
Now desperately engaged in a major damage limitation exercise , senior CDU officials are beginning to ponder a strategy to check the party 's fast depleting funds amid the realisation that the scandal will cost the party about 18 million euros in fines alone , apart from drying out contributions from the dwindling supporters of the CDU .
Germany 's most controversial arms dealer and lobbyist , Mr . Schreiber , now exiled in Canada and facing German tax dodging charges , threatens to spill the beans and promises revelations that he says will push top CDU leaders ` ` into a hole so deep you would not hear them hitting the bottom .
' ' The average European is shocked by the party shenanigans in major European countries from Britain to Italy and from Spain to Russia , but the Kohl affair is rated as a major blow to the so- called ethical standards in European public life .
