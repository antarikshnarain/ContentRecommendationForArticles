Sri Lankan politics

Sir , - Mr. A. P. Venkateswaran 's article , ` ` Civil war in Sri Lanka' ' ( TheHindu , Jan. 21 ) , has not only failed to point out how the present regime or , for that matter , even the earlier one reduced Sri Lankan Tamils to ` second class ' citizens but also indirectly pleaded for dismemberment of the island .
When Buddhism was once again accorded primacy in the draft Constitution presented by Ms. Kumaratunga in 1997 , there was no objection from either Hindu religious leaders or the Sri Lankan Tamils in general .
Incidentally , since the 10th century A.D. , Lord Buddha has been one of the Hindu avatars and both Hindu and Buddhist shrines are frequented by the Buddhists and Hindus alike .
About Sir Hugh Cleghorn 's despatch , Mr . Venkateswaran had better read more about Sri Lanka 's history before putting him on a pedestal he little deserves .
