Siwach's `golden goal' does the trick for Railways

A silken touch by Pritam Siwach fetched the ` golden goal ' for Railways in its hard-earned 1-0 triumph over Mumbai in the semifinals of the 50th National women 's hockey championship at the Pandit Ravi Shankar Shukla Stadium here on Tuesday .
It was indeed an emotional crisis for the Railway skipper Pritam Siwach , as the centre-forward broke into tears after connecting the fierce drive from the left by Suraj Lata Devi into the cage , in the 10th minute of extra-time .
The team started off in right earnest , forcing three penalty corners in the first three minutes , though it had to be admitted that Mumbai missed a fine chance when Sanghai Ibemhal Chanu made a feeble attempt off a pass from Poonam Surin in the first minute .
Skipper Lakshmi Shree at the halfline made a couple of fine crosses from the right , but Mamta Kharab was not sharp in availing of those chances , and when she did march towards the goal in the first half of extratime , the Railway goalkeeper Tingoleima Chanu stormed out confidently to defuse tension .
With the team not able to stop the ball ` dead ' most of the time during the penalty corner drills , it was difficult for Railways to take the lead , despite trying Sita Gussain and Maristella Tirkey apart from the dependable Sandeep Kaur as the strikers in the set-piece situation .
However , once it scored the goal , as Meenakshi converted the penalty stroke with a shaky push to the left of the Punjab goalkeeper Amandeep Kaur , who allowed to elude her grasp , Haryana played a lot more confidently .
