Growth and poverty

Yet , estimates based on data collected during the official National Sample Survey over the past decade unambiguously point to a deterioration in rural India , a marginal improvement in urban centres and an overall increase in both the number and proportion of people living below the poverty line .
An evaluation of the poverty norms , the methodology of estimation and the quality of NSS data has to be undertaken as a matter of priority in order to settle doubts about the accuracy of the poverty estimates .
Since the reduction of rural impoverishment has always been closely linked to rapid growth in agriculture , it is possible that the slow-down , aided by the stagnancy in funding of and larger leakages from rural development programmes , caused a setback to rural poverty alleviation .
As both these sets of activities are concentrated in urban areas , the reduction of urban poverty and the deterioration in the rural areas are both consistent with the pattern and pace of growth in the previous decade .
If the estimates of the course of poverty during the Nineties are an accurate reflection of the developments on the ground , it certainly does not mean that the country is better off returning to the pre-reform economic policies .
Second , the excessive concern with the reform of fiscal , industrial and trade policies and the corresponding neglect of rural development policies has not helped the cause of poverty alleviation .
