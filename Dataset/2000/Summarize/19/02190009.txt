Statutory powers for IRDA by May: Sinha

` ` By the first week of May all formalities including statutory powers for the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority ( IRDA ) will be completed,' ' Mr. Sinha told PTI , adding that the first private insurance companies would start operating in three to six months thereafter .
Asked why there was delay in the notification of FEMA ( which replaces FERA ) , Mr. Sinha said there are several details which needed to be worked out including setting up of an appellate tribunal as provided in the Bill .
The Finance Minister did not agree with the view that there was delay in the notification of FEMA as the Government was keen to notify it along with Prevention of Money Laundering Bill which has been referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee .
