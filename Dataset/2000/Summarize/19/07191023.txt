Top three seeds bite the dust

1 at the Century Club turned out to be the ` graveyard of seeds ' as the top three - Aisam Quereshi of Pakistan , Prahlad Srinath of India and Vladislav Svarc of Slovakia - perished one after the other on a dramatic day 's play in the $ 10,000 Wearhouse-ITF Futures Tennis Championship here on Tuesday .
There was something to cheer for the Indian supporters as Mustafa Ghouse pulled off a hard fought 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-4 victory over the sixth seeded Nir Welgreen of Israel .
There was a sizeable crowd to cheer Srinath , but his big-built Dutch rival , Sander Groen proved to be a spoilsport as he felled the big Indian hope at 6-3 , 6-4 .
The Russian , Smolenski Ivanov treated the friendly serve of Kamala Kannan like a cannon fodder and rolled to a 6-3 , 6-3 win while Boris Borgula of Slovakia drubbed Rohan Bopanna 6-0 , 6-2 in 47 minutes , which incidentally was shortest match of the day .
