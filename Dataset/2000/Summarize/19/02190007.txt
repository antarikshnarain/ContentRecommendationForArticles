IA employees, management on a collision course

Indian Airlines employees are set on a collision course with the management over the decision to decrease the retirement age of employees to 58 years from 60 .
What has upset most employees is that the decision affecting hundreds of them was couched in secrecy and got cleared by a truncated Board of Directors on a day when the quorum was not complete .
Two other members , the managing- director of Air India , Mr M. D. Mascarenhas and the chairman of Airports Authority of India , Mr D. V. Gupta , who were not present , sent in their letters of approval in absentia-to a proposal that was not even mentioned in the agenda !
The unkindest cut is that the decision has been spear-headed by the bureaucrat chairman-cum-managing director , who himself will retire at age 60 as per the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission .
Describing the move as ` ` discriminatory' ' , they protested the justification saying Indian Airline had made a cumulative profit of Rs 31.20 crore till November , 1999 , so there was no justification to reduce staff for cutting costs .
About 1100 employees of erstwhile Vayudoot Airline were merged into Indian Airline , adding to the number of manpower to an aircraft , which is about 350 per aircraft , as against 250 or less for other airlines .
