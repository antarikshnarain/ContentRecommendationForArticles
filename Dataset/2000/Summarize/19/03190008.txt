Ekeus nominated UNMOVIC head

In nominating the Swedish diplomat , Mr . Rolf Ekeus , as the head of the new United Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) , mandated to discover and destroy Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , the Secretary General , Mr. Kofi Annan , has apparently resorted to a holding operation .
Russia , or one of Iraq 's other friends on the Security Council , is very likely to veto Mr . Ekeus 's nomination and since this possibility would have been taken into account , Mr. Annan has basically asked the Security Council to make up its collective mind .
On several occasions , the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) which was UNMOVIC 's predecessor , seemed more intent on finding proof of Iraqi non-compliance with the inspection regime than in finding out the details of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and destroying them .
Although Iraq was to find that Mr. Ekeus 's successor , the Australian diplomat , Mr. Richard Butler , was an even stronger upholder of U.S. interests , Baghdad has not forgotten that Mr . Ekeus was not blameless either .
While the Iraqi regime is certainly not lily-white , most Governments do agree that Baghdad has a right to demand that the executive chairman come without any pre-meditated notions of Iraqi non- compliance or non-cooperation .
What is more important is that the resolution provides scope for four-monthly suspensions of the embargo on imports , provided UNMOVIC reports , within a few months of the commencement of its operations , that Iraq is fully complying with the resolutions , that is , it is co-operating wholeheartedly with the inspection teams .
