CM refutes criticism on farmers' market

The Chief Minister , launching a livestock protection programme at Thirukazhukundram , said those who were against the scheme had even planted reports in newspapers that farmers were not interested in the scheme as the business was dull in the marketing centres .
The programme would provide veterinary services at the doorsteps of farmers , as the rural people paid scant attention to their own health , let alone the health of the livestock they reared and depended upon .
Similar to the farmers ' market , Mr. Karunanidhi said the preventive health care ( Varum mun Kappom ) programme had proved a great success and in the 237 camps conducted in 21 districts so far , about 3.17 lakh people had been screened and 23,244 of them referred for further attention at base hospitals .
The Chief Minister said 425 veterinary professionals drawn from Veterinary Services Department and the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University ( TANUVAS ) rendered the necessary services .
The Animal Husbandry Secretary , Mr.Mohan Varghese Chunkath , said the Government proposed to conduct 383 such camps every month from February and Rs.38.3 lakhs had been set apart for the current year , ending March 31 .
Mr.K.Sundaram , Minister for Dairy Development , Dr.R.Prabaharan , Vice Chancellor , TANUVAS , Mr.A.Sukumaran , Kancheepuram Collector , Ms.R.Leelavathi , Director , Veterinary Services stressed the need to enhance livestock productivity .
