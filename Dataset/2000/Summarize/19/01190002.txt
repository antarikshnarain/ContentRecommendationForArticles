Clinton visit soon, says Summers

The visiting United States Treasury Secretary , Mr Lawrence H. Summers , today confirmed that the U. S . President , Mr. Bill Clinton , would be visiting India ` ` sooner than later,' ' but side- stepped all queries on a possible lifting of sanctions imposed against India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998 .
Asked specifically whether it was normal for the U. S. President to visit a country which was under sanctions imposed by the U. S . itself , Mr. Summers simply said , ` ` it is normal for the President to visit a country with which United States has friendly relations and where he feels that relations can improve in the future .
' ' Mr. Clinton had also made it clear that issues concerning economic potential were very important to him , Mr Summers said and added that ` ` when the President comes here , he will be looking forward and not backwards .
He also requested Mr. Summers to lift the sanctions on lending by financial institutions and to resume the facility of General System of Preferences which had been extended to Indian exports in the past .
Other issues of disagreement between India and the U.S. , especially about the Washington 's insistence on including labour standards in the World Trade Organisation , figured in the separate discussions that Mr Summers had with Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Sinha .
He said that Pakistan did not figure at all during the discussions here but added that ` ` I know it is an important issue and must have figured in the talks between Mr. Jaswant Singh and Mr. Strobe Talbott .
