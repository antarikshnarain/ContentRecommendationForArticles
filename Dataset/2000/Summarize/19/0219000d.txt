Cong.-NCP coordination panel to meet

The NCP and the Congress ( I ) appear set to attract flak from the smaller parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal ( Secular ) for running the Government without taking them into confidence .
Most of the steam is likely to be let off by the SP , the JD ( U ) , two factions of the RPI , the BRP-BMS , the Peasants and Workers ' Party and the CPI ( M ) which supports the Government but is not a member of the Ministry .
Ironically , all the parties , except the CPI ( M ) have representatives , along with independents , in the Ministry but some entities such as the JD ( U ) have none in the Cabinet where decisions are taken .
Today , for instance , Mr. Nihal Ahmed , JD ( U ) chief for Maharashtra , made it known that because they have the compulsion of sustaining a secular Government to keep the Sena-BJP out all the time , they would do nothing to bring the NCP-Congress ( I ) -led Government down .
Most of the parties are chaffing at the recent decision to make English compulsory from Standard I in schools even if the normal requirement of teachers are not available for teaching existing subjects .
