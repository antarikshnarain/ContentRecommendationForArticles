Cyber laws need to be framed, says Kalam

There is also an urgent need to enact a law to protect under water,' ' he said , delivering the first golden jubilee lecture on ` Law and Dimensions of Technology ' , as part of the golden jubilee celebrations of the Supreme Court Bar Association ( SCBA ) here today .
The nuclear scientist warned of information warfare in the next five years and said there was an urgent need to enact cyber laws , otherwise the ` ` hagging,' ' which had already started , had the potential to damage the economy of the country .
Dr. Kalam said on May 11 , 1998 , the Indian scientists tested the nuclear weapon thus declaring India a Nuclear Weapon State ( NWS ) .
The developed countries clamped restrictions on ` ` our indigenous R & D organisations with denial of technology , loans from World Bank , denial of business centres , but the indigenous technology and self-reliance on food combated the situation .
The present Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) is a glaring example of how five nuclear weapon countries can steam-roll the agenda of an international treaty of far reaching consequence,' ' he said .
Now the same CTBT is being blatantly used to serve the non-proliferation agenda of the NWS with total disregard to either the original nuclear disarmament goals or to the legitimate security compulsions of India , which is now a NWS .
