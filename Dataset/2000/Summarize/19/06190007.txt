Reforms - Reckoning without labour?

But the point made by Mr. Jatiya that about 50 million workers engaged in an array of occupations such as beedi-rolling , weaving , gem cutting , garment making , papad processing and agarbathi making - representing an economically disadvantaged section of the population - need legislative protection is not as simplistic as it sounds .
Is the Union Government merely articulating the desperate cause of workers trapped in such occupations or is it seriously considering the imposition of a formal statutory status on the informal sector in industry without much thought for the complexity if not the impracticability of such an approach in an economy which is fast getting absorbed by market forces ?
Whether it is the future of the handloom industry or that of garment making in the decentralised sector , much more than legal safeguards , what the workers would need is an integrated policy package which takes care of markets for final products as well as the requirements of supply of raw materials along with those of credit and capital .
But in the developing countries with abysmal levels of literacy and occupational education , the adverse impact of economic reforms ( with the axiomatic creed of downsizing passing for enhancement of competitive efficiency ) is coming through in the form of retrenchment of labour in all but the sectors where ` ` knowledge' ' enjoys a premium .
It is crucial therefore that the ` ` reform mindset' ' should engage itself increasingly in the challenging task of intertwining the so-called second generation reforms with the process of promoting employment rather than merely reconciling itself to the loss of jobs in the private and public sector as a misperceived precondition for global economic integration .
Granting that the thousands of employees of the Electricity Boards are legitimately perturbed by the fear of retrenchment arising from the restructuring strategy , should they be given the short shrift or merely bulldozed into accepting bifurcation , trifurcation or whatever of the Electricity Board ?
