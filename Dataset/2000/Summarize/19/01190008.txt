Agreement on seat adjustment eludes NDA

The Bharatiya Janata Party 's Central Election Committee , at its meeting here today , was unable to take up the task of declaring its candidates for the assembly polls in the absence of final seat adjustment with any of its allies .
It is now scheduled to meet again tomorrow afternoon when it hopes to achieve some progress in its talks with the allies - the Samata Party and the Janata Dal ( United ) in Bihar , the Indian National Lok Dal in Haryana and the Biju Janata Dal in Orissa .
With the process of nominations on in Bihar for the first phase covering 108 seats , Mr. Vajpayee may have to intervene and talk directly to the Samata and JD ( U ) leaders if matters are not sorted out in a day or two .
Both the BJP and the JD ( U ) confirmed that the allies would contest the elections in Bihar on a common manifesto , and have a joint campaign under a joint leadership .
Mr. Raghupathy of the JD ( U ) and Mr. Sushil Modi of the BJP said that there was a clear understanding among all the allies that the basic aim was to form an NDA government in Bihar by ` ` defeating the jungle raj of the Rashtriya Janata Dal .
The BJP said that the JD ( U ) has signalled that it wants to contest the ` ` same number' ' of seats as the Samata , and the Bihar people 's Party of Mr. Anand Mohan Singh has given a list of nearly 40 seats .
