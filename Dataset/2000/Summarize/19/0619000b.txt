A worrisome trend 

In an article with the apt caption " Ethics be damned , Let 's merge' ' in the August 23-30 , 1999 issue of Business Week , Mr . Jeffrey E. Garten , Dean of the Yale School of Management,' ' describes the portents and pitfalls of a marriage between an auditing firm and a legal firm .
He gives three compelling factors for this itch to merge , namely : ( i ) A strong demand for sophisticated financial and retirement planning for a one-stop shopping ( akin to our own one-window clearance ) for both legal and accounting advices .
( iii ) The voracious appetite of big accounting firms - their obsession to leverage their accounting relationship to help clients do other things - plan their corporate strategies , build and manage their information technology system and now solve client 's legal problems .
The article goes on to succinctly point out the difficulties and dangers if such mergers do take place , namely : ( a ) Conflict of interests - undermining of two crucial ` underpinnings ' of America 's market economy - independent auditing and sound legal advice .
Mr . Garten cites the example of PricewaterhouseCoopers with 1.55 lakh employees spread over 150 countries and asks us to imagine their problems of co-ordinating disparate businesses , implementing new strategies , monitoring quality control and melding different professional cultures and compensation systems .
Let us take the instance of the big five in the international accounting and consulting field , namely , Pricewaterhouse Coopers , KMG Peat Marwich , Arthur Anderson , Ernst & Young and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsv .
