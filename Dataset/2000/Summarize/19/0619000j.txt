The way to have fun and pull together Intervention at Mastek India

The difference in economic status between the Managing Director and the commissionaire exists but there is very little social difference , and even if it is there , the concept has fallen prey to the mantra of political correctness .
The Far East In the Far East , notably Japan , the hierarchical structure is rigid , bordering on veneration for the top boss .
The Japanese culture is structured around the " father-figure " model where the Head of a corporation is considered as the pater familias or as the benign parent to be venerated and followed without question .
In China , Hong Kong , Taiwan and to an extent in Singapore , the " Taipan " concept mimics the Japanese model though there are cracks appearing in the structures there due to the influence from the West .
The Runtime Concept Runtime - is a Mastek family affair where right from the CMD to the office attendant with their families , travel together in a 2nd class railway compartment to a fun destination and vacation for a few days in a five star hotel .
Often families are unaware of what the wage earner does for the long hours s/he spends at the office , Runtime is the ideal time families can observe , at first hand , the equations at the workplace and the nature of the job .
