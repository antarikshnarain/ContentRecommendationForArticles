Bid to moderate harsh statements?

The Pakistani Chief Executive , Gen. Pervez Musharraf 's interview to TheHindu , his first to any Indian newspaper , is being seen here as a major effort by Pakistan to moderate some of the harsher statements that have emanated from Islamabad .
` ` So , therefore , I would request now that Indians....if they keep harping on what I said and did at Kargil and this hijacking and that , you are not going to make progress...' ' the General said , adding that he would not turn his cheek to ` ` flak' ' from across the border .
` ` When the General talks about trust and being taken at face value , he wants that India should engage him,' ' Syed Talat Hussain , Executive Editor of The News , told this correspondent .
Ever since October 12 , 1999 , India has shunned the military Government of Gen. Musharraf , a policy that exhausted itself following the Kandahar hijack when the External Affairs Minister , Mr. Jaswant Singh , made a desperate call to his Pakistani counterpart , Mr. Abdul Sattar .
Islamabad , too , must appreciate that public sentiment in India after Kandahar and the statements of Masood Azhar is dark and that the quality of contacts between the two sides is precariously hinged on Pakistan 's showing good faith on issues of terrorism .
But here it has been... now , I do n't believe in hypocrisy - whereas the military 's playing a role , you still say no , no military 's not playing a role....,' ' the General said .
