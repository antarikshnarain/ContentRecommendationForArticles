Not in public interest

On the contrary , the Government 's decision will affect a larger section of the middle and lower middle classes including non- pensioned retirees whose only hope are the small savings schemes , especially the Post Office Monthly Income Plan , in an era of fly- by-night financial companies .
Additionally , many State Governments which benefit by these schemes will be affected in spite of their share increasing from 75 to 80 per cent of the net collections ; for , small savings investments will come down , thanks to the interest reduction , and again people will be tempted to risk their investment in private financial companies for high returns .
