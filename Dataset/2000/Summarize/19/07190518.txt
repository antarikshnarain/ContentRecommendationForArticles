A satisfying tour, says Baskaran

Aside from playing the four-nation tournament featuring Germany , Spain and Canada , the Indian team played three Test matches against Belgium and a one-off Test against Canada .
Quite predictably , Baskaran picks Gagan Ajit Singh as the outstanding material among the youngsters and heaps praise on the player for the manner in which he scored a hat-trick against Canada in the penultimate match of the tour .
