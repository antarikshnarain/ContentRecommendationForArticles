A strategic approach for implementation 

The strong positive factors such as growing web usage , well evolved IP standards , rapid application development tools , single market place , global reach and Euro make the organisations feel confident of e-commerce , say Sendur Chelvi Madhavan and Sridhar Chandrasekar .
Businesses can not succeed in their e-commerce venture unless careful steps are taken towards redefining the business flow , populating corporate data from legacy systems , integrating with the existing ERP system , efficiently modifying the SCM and CRM , and implementing stringent security measures .
However , these applications can also be broadly classified under B-to-B or B-to-C . An integrated business solution According to Mr. Richard Campbell , President of Bright Star Systems , e-commerce is a dynamic set of technologies , applications and business practices that link enterprises , customers and suppliers through electronic transactions .
Architecture of e-commerce A simple web application can be designed as a three-tier ( browser , web server and database ) architecture constituting three modules , namely , Presentation logic , which deals with the HTML pages that help the user to navigate through the organisational information , Data logic , which deals with databases related to the application , and Business logic - the interface between presentation logic and data logic .
For instance , when a customer orders an item online , the order should immediately get into the order management system that might be residing in an Oracle database and the supply chain management ( SCM ) that might be residing in an Ingress database .
The transaction system of e-commerce should take care of the 24 x 7 ( 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ) uptime of the application , transaction integrity , concurrent system interface , ability to handle the increase in volume of transaction , risk management and recovery system .
