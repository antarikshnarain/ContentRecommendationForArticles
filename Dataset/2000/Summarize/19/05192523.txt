CTBT: a phoney consensus?

Let us recall the principled opposition that Ambassador Arundathi Ghosh put up in Geneva some years ago when she said ` ` India will never sign the Treaty , not now , not later'' .
The removal of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai would mean it can receive books and magazines and maybe low-power computers from the U.S . How the objectives of non-proliferation were met by the earlier listing will be clear only to the nuclear cold warriors of the U.S. !
The senior scientists of the nuclear and defence establishments are reported to have advised the Government that India possesses adequate information on nuclear weapons design for different purposes based on results obtained from the five Pokhran-II tests .
Also it has been reported that the U.S. would supply China and France with weapon test information on the ground that this will improve the safety of their nuclear weapons .
It does not want India or anyone else to question the danger to the world posed by the large nuclear arsenals of the U.S. , Russia , China , France and Britain .
The Government of India has hastily announced import from the U.S. of some 1,500 items covering a wide range of consumer articles which are being produced within the country and which provide vital employment to millions of our country men and women .
