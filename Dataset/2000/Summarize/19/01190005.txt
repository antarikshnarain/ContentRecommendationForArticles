Militants will find it hot in J&K; 

The Vajpayee Government 's ` ` offensive strategy' ' to tackle cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir has turned the focus on 49 newly-carved sectors in the Counter- Insurgency ( CI ) grid and making them self-sufficient .
According to top officials of the Home Ministry who were involved in evolving the action plan in association with Defence Ministry officials , a majority of the 49 CI sectors can be described as ` ` hyper-sensitive'' .
( As part of the move to flush out the militants , ` ` if we have to blow up even our own buildings , we would do so as we do n't want the militants to go back alive,' ' PTI reported quoting the sources .
) In the post-Kargil scenario , particularly after the military regime took over in Pakistan , the attacks became more desperate and were launched deep inside the areas held by the security forces in Badamibagh , Bandipur , Handwara , the Government Secretariat in Srinagar and Jammu .
As against 85 foreign mercenaries killed in 1995 , as many as 319 were killed in 1998 and in the first 10 months of last year about 260 foreign mercenaries were killed in the CI operations .
As ` ` suicide squads' ' or ` ` fidayen' ' targeted army and para-military camps , it was obvious that the militants were bent on demoralising the security forces .
