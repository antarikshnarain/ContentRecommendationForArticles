CPI, CPI(ML) reach accord on seat sharing in Bihar

The CPI and the CPI ( ML ) went ahead with their announcement leaving behind the Forward Bloc , the RSP , the MCPI and the SUCI with whom they intend to forge a new front in the State .
The Samajwadi Party list is a long one demanding 158 seats , whereas the CPI and the CPI ( ML ) have set aside 268 constituencies for themselves out of the 324-member Assembly that goes to the polls next month .
The two left parties , however , maintained that efforts would be made to accommodate the SP by making sacrifices whereever possible.Actually , the CPI and the CPI ( ML ) have themselves not been able to avoid friendly clashes in 25 constituencies .
As per their agreement , the CPI will receive the support of the CPI ( ML ) in 154 constituencies and the former intends to reciprocate the latter in 84 seats.They failed to reach a consensus on 25 constituencies .
The CPI ( ML ) leader , Mr. Umesh Singh , justified the party 's decision to field its candidates from these constituencies which the CPI had won in the 1995 Assembly elections which it had contested in alliance with the erstwhile Janata Dal .
The most surprising aspect of the coming together of the CPI and the CPI ( ML ) is that they would be fielding candidates against sitting members of the CPI ( M ) and the MCC , unlike in the Lok Sabha elections when care was taken to avoid a showdown within the Left firmament .
