Congress(I) plans 'offensive' against Gujarat order

The Congress ( I ) will launch an offensive against the Gujarat Government 's circular which allows Government servants to take part in the activities of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh .
The Congress ( I ) sankalp yatra , which was earlier to converge in Delhi on January 30 ( Martyr 's Day ) , will now be diverted to the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad .
All the CWC members will take a pledge at Gandhi Smriti in Delhi ( where the Father of the Nation fell to Nathuram Godse 's bullet ) that day .
Two CWC members , Mr. Ahmed Patel and Mr. Rajesh Pilot , expressed apprehension over the Gujarat Government 's move as dangerous .
Mrs . Mohsinha Kidwai , CWC member and AICC general secretary in charge of Bihar , welcomed Mr. Hari Ram Sardar of the JMM ( Soren ) and Mr . Devipad Upahdyay of the CPI into the party .
The Congress ( I ) 's central election committee , which was to meet today to begin finalising candidates for the Assembly elections , has been postponed since Mrs. Gandhi is in Amethi .
