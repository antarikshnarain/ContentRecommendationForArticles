No policy innovation in J&K; strategy

The Prime Minister-led review of the security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir has expectedly led to a reaffirmation of the Vajpayee Government 's resolve to defeat the ` ` proxy war' ' , unleashed and sustained by Pakistan .
That the Jammu and Kashmir review , first since November 18 , 1999 , should have taken place at 7 , Race Course Road clearly indicates a realisation that Mr. Advani has not exactly succeeded in getting the better of the situation .
The problem for the ruling coalition at the Centre is that it has allowed itself to be so unseemingly and so inextricably bracketed with the National Conference regime ; and , to the extent Dr . Farooq Abdullah is seen as not commanding popular acceptance , New Delhi is seen siding with an unpopular regime against the people of Kashmir .
One major argument throughout 1995- 96 , it will be recalled , in favour of restoration of ` ` democratic' ' rule was that an elected Government in Srinagar would provide a buffer between New Delhi and the alienated masses .
And because New Delhi is seen as hostile to the non- National Conference political voices , the anti-Abdullah and anti- Centre sentiments naturally gets channelised by the All Party Hurriyat Conference .
While these macho noises help reassure the domestic constituency , all this din about ` ` extra security measures' ' help Pakistan sustain the notion internationally that ` ` Kashmir' ' was at a flash-point , and that the international community better force New Delhi to enter into a dialogue .
