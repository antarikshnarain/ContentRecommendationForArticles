Donald comes to India with a purpose

` ` His future now is with Warwickshire,' ' said a high-ranking United Cricket Board of South Africa official recently and , although he will return to South Africa in September after the English county season , it will require a superhuman effort for him to force his way back into the Test side .
Fred Trueman , a fast bowler of a different type from a completely different era , took 307 wickets in 67 Tests ; Donald has 290 in 67 .
Trueman relied on a subtler set of variations , based on a classic action , a round arm delivery and an unforgettable outswinger that often started on leg stump and hit middle and off .
Not for him the slower , more delicate improvement of Richard Hadlee , the most complete fast bowler of this era , nor the consistency of Kapil Dev , nor the inch-perfect precision of the late Malcolm Marshall .
So we must presume , as usual , that Trueman would have been as big a legend now as he was in the 1960s and 1970s ; that Donald would have taken his Test wickets by the handful 50 years ago.What is certain is that we will miss Donald as we miss Trueman .
They always say there are no characters left in the game , but one day Nantie Hayward , Shaun Pollock , Darren Gough and the rest will be spoken of in tones of awe just as Trueman 's feats are now celebrated .
