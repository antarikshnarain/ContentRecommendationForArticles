Grozny stormed again

Russian forces launched a decisive onslaught on the rebel-held Chechen capital of Grozny today , with the miliary vowing to capture the city in the next two-three days .
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian Army regional headquarters as saying that troops , advancing from three directions , had pushed as far as the city centre .
The Chechens ' Deputy Chief of Staff , Mr. Aslanbek Ismailov , told Interfax that the Russians had been heavily shelling Grozny , but have indeed failed to win a new foothold in the city .
The Kremlin appears anxious to break organised Chechen resistance early in order to pre-empt reprisal from the new Russian Duma , which went into session on Tuesday , and expected accusations of military incompetetence in dealing with the breakaway republic .
