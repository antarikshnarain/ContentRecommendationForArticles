Voltas' CP gets A1+ rating 

The rating takes into account the comfortable liquidity position and the company 's improved financial risk profile arising from its exit from the white goods and agro-chemicals manufacturing activities , and its renewed focus on its traditional activities like air- conditioning , engineering and chemical trading .
This resulted in an improvement in gearing levels ( Total Debt / Tangible Net Worth ) , which declined to 1.24 times as on March 31 , 1999 from 2.28 times as of March 31 , 1998 .
Though the room air conditioning division 's turnover is marginally lower in the current financial year ( till date ) , as compared to levels in the same period of last year , its mining equipment division is executing a large order from Coal India Limited .
The rating reflects a comfortable market position in the domestic tea industry , favourable performance on operating parameters , comfortable capital structure and moderate financial risk profile .
While the rating also factors Dhunseri 's proposed investments in the greenfield petrochemical project to be implemented by an affiliate company , higher than anticipated investments in the project could have a negative impact on the company 's risk profile .
The rating reflects the company 's strong linkage with the Hero group , access to business and financial support from cash rich group companies and its dominant market position in component supplies to Hero Honda and Hero Cycles , and its steady financial position characterised by a strong growth in turnover and moderate interest coverage ( as measured by PBDIT/ Interest and Finance Charges ) .
