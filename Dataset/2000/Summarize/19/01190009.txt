HC rejects TRAI plan on cellphones

The Delhi High Court today struck down the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 's ( TRAI ) revenue sharing regulation of May 1999 on inter-connection charges between service providers and ` Calling Party Pays ' ( CPP ) scheme under which incoming calls on cellular phones were proposed to be made free .
` ` The TRAI can not lay down terms and conditions to service providers on introduction of telecom service , installation of equipment , technology and regulate in respect of the telecom industry,' ' the Bench ruled saying that the TRAI 's power in this regard were only ` ` recommendatory' ' and the Government was not bound to obey the advice .
The court advised the TRAI to devise any other alternative scheme in place of CPP with mutual consultation of all parties including DoT and the MTNL and reminded the regulator that its ` ` adjudicatory' ' role on a dispute between service providers could be invoked only when they fail to arrive at an accord .
