Shooting nightmares

Rivers , beaches , forests and mountains are being destroyed by man , whose education and knowledge hardly seem to warn him of the tragedy that can befall his children if he continues with his reckless ways .
Recently , well-wishers sought legal redress when they found that a Mumbai film company had erected a mammoth set on the fascinating Lord Wenlock Downs , close to Ooty .
While shootings must not be permitted - under any circumstance - in wildlife sanctuaries and national parks , they may be allowed in reserve forests , but with certain restrictions .
Animals jealously guard their territory , and if they are forced out of it - and they will in all probability , because film-making is invariably din and confusion - they tend to become confused and angry .
At a time when forests are shrinking - they cover about 10 per cent of the country today against 40 per cent a century earlier - the administration needs to take hard decisions , even if they knock off the smile from cinema .
Most of them are well informed and capable of responsible behaviour ; it would seem almost tragic if these mortals were to join poachers and rippers in the destruction of our environment .
