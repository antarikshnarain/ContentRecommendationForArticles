Knowledge that liberates

The knowledge of the Self ( Atman ) is the highest wisdom knowing which a person comes to terms with himself and with the whole world .
The happiness that man seeks from the world of objects is as ephemeral as the objects themselves , but the bliss of the Self is always there and it can not be taken away .
So happiness must be sought within and the whole attempt to share this knowledge with others by those who have experienced it is to enable others also to realise it .
Just as all the best of empirical knowledge and technology are being shared by one and all , the supreme knowledge of the Self must be also shared with everyone as the time has come when it can no longer remain the prerogative of a few .
Just as a person picks up all the skills necessary to live in the world , Self- knowledge is essential to understand oneself and lead a fulfilled life .
The Bhagavad Gita says , ` ` This knowledge is a sovereign science , a sovereign secret , supremely holy , most excellent , directly enjoyable , attended with virtue , very easy to practise and imperishable .
