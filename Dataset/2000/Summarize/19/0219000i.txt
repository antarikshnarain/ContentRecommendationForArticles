PDS: NE Food Ministers seek Centre's help

The conference of Food and Civil Supplies Ministers of the seven North-Eastern States , West Bengal and Sikkim , here today , discussed the whole gamut of problems relating to the public distribution system ( PDS ) .
But it is on the vital question of preventing large-scale stealing and blackmarketing of PDS items , as brought out by a study undertaken by Tata Economic and Consultancy Services ( TECS ) , the Ministers failed to suggest any effective steps .
All that the conference decided was that the Food and Civil Supplies Department of the States should publish in the local newspapers the monthly allotments made to the districts and sub- divisions and the district and sub-divisional authorities , in turn , should release to the press and local Consumer Forums the list of the allottees and the quantities of various items allotted every month .
Similarly , to prevent massive smuggling of rice and sugar to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh , the conference suggested that no new fair price shops should be opened or new licenses issued to wholesalers in the border areas.Also , the Food and Civil Supplies Departments of the States having international borders should ` ` take follow up action to ensure prosecution of persons' ' engaged in smuggling and the district authorities should also ` ` review the situation with their counterparts across the border .
