NCP against review of Constitution

The Nationalist Congress Party 's Working Committee today passed two resolutions expressing disquiet over the Centre 's proposal to review the Constitution and the Gujarat Government 's decision to allow its servants to take part in RSS activities .
Urging the Prime Minister to persuade the Gujarat Government to withdraw its circular , the resolution said the move was part of an emerging pattern to saffronise the body politic .
The Vajpayee Government 's proposal to set up a committee to review the Constitution virtually amounted to a contempt of Parliament , Mr. Devendra Dwivedi , NCP general secretary and spokesman , said .
Only Parliament could amend the Constitution and the appointment of a government committee in derogation of the House was unprecedented in the annals of democracy .
