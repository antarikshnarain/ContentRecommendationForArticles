Austalia's top 12 of last century

It was not quirk of fate that brought together Arthur Morris of the ` Don Bradman 's 1948 Invincibles ' and contemporary cricket 's leg spinning maestro Shane Warne , but Australian cricket history 's another significant chapter and a momentous time when Australian cricket picked its ` Top Dozen ' of the last century from a basket of twenty .
Many of them have been cricket idols and heroes until now ; they were named Australia 's ` ` Top Dozen' ' cricketers of the 20th century and bestowed icon-like status at an investiture ceremony at the Convention Centre , adjacent to the Darling Harbour Super Market .
The Academy of Selectors had four foreigners in India 's Sunil Gavaskar , England 's Lord Colin Cowdrey , Sir Alec Bedser and West Indies ' Sir Garfield Sobers .
The Australians were Bill Brown , Arthur Morris , Neil Harvey , Riche Benaud , Bob Simpson , Bill Lawry , Ian Chappell , Greg Chappell , Graham Yallop , Kim Hughes , Allan Border , Mark Taylor , Stephen Waugh and journalists Mike Coward , Peter Roebuck and Phil Wilkins .
Steve Waugh had not put down Neil Harvey 's name , but the dapper batsman who was only 20 years old in the ` 48 Invincibles ' made 6149 runs in 79 Tests with 21 centuries and 24 half centuries was a clear choice of majority of the panelists of which he too was a member .
Australia 's top 12 of the last decade : Donald George Bradman ( Captain ) , Arthur Robert Morris , William Harold Ponsford , Gregory Stephen Chappell , Robert Neil Harvey , Keith Ross Miller , Ian Andrew Healy , Raymond Russell Lindwall , Shane Keith Warne , Dennis Keith Lillee , William Joseph O'Reilly , Allan Robert Border .
