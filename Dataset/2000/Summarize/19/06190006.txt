LG Electronics' investment plans

LG Electronics today announced plans to invest $ 50 million in its Indian subsidiary during the year 2000 .
The investment will cover realignment to bring the PC monitor business under its own control , a new manufacturing plant and launch of 16 new products and commencement of its e-commerce drive with the launch of the web site www.lgindia.com .
Part of the planned investment will be earmarked for a new refrigerator plant at the company 's sprawling manufacturing complex on the national capital 's outskirts .
Such a step would help close the price gap with Indian companies like BPL and Videocon whose final products are cheaper as they source components indigenously .
