Negative FDI list soon, says Maran

This would imply that barring sectors such as defence , atomic energy and narcotics , FDI will be permitted in all other areas through the automatic route , where permission has to be sought directly from the Reserve Bank of India without seeking approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board ( FIPB ) .
This was disclosed by Mr. Murasoli Maran , Union Minister for Commerce and Industry , during his meeting with the business delegation from Singapore , led by Mr. S. Chandra Das , Chairman , India Business Group Steering Committee , here today .
They apprised Mr. Maran about their perception of various bottle-necks hindering FDI inflows in particular the problems relating to repatriation of earnings , availing of foreign loans in projects and procedural delays .

Khattar from First Capital Corporation Ltd. , and Mr. Albert Hong Kin Kay of RSP Architects Planners and Engineers Ltd . -
