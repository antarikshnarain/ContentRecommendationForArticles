Senior AIADMK leaders call on Moopanar

If the AIADMK general secretary , Ms. Jayalalitha , calling on the TMC president , Mr. G. K. Moopanar , sometime ago and the subsequent meeting of the two leaders at an Ifthar party were described as events suggesting a thaw in the relationship between the two parties , another event slated for February 2 is bound to set more tongues wagging .
Two senior functionaries of the AIADMK , Mr. K. A. Sengottaiyan and Mr. Karuppusamy Pandian , today called on Mr. Moopanar and handed over a letter from Ms. Jayalalitha inviting him to participate in a meeting she was organising to condole the death of V. R. Nedunchezhian , who was AIADMK party chairman .
Though no indication is available from the TMC sources , the fact remains that Mr.Moopanar is now holding elaborate discussions with senior leaders of the party on the future course to be adopted keeping in view the recent positive signals both from the Congress ( I ) and the AIADMK .
However , some TMC leaders seem to hold the view that there is no urgency to take a decision regarding electoral alliance before the by-elections to the three Assembly segments , scheduled to be held on February 17 .
They also feel that the Congress ( I ) should be involved in any effort to form an electoral alliance in the State because they feel that the right course would be to firm up some kind of coordination with the Congress ( I ) before entering into any arrangement with other parties .
Meanwhile , though two senior leaders of the Pondicherry unit of the Congress ( I ) had met Mr. Moopanar a couple of days ago and held talks , the slow progress in regard to the Pondicherry issue is attributed to the Congress ( I ) high command 's preoccupation with polls in some northern States .
