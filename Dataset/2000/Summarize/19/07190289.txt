England wins a close Test

A day that began as a piece of cricket ritual after three days lost to rain turned into a rivetting moment in the game 's history after each side in the fifth Test sacrificed an innings in an attempt to give the match bite and meaning .
England won , after a daring innings by Alec Stewart and Michael Vaughan 's first Test 50 in a fifth wicket stand of 126 , by two wickets with five balls in hand .
Protests came in from those who had put money on a draw as well as purists who felt that the Law 14.2 had been broken - technically at least - because no attempt was made to start the England first innings .
Of course it is ridiculous to suggest that any player of either side would contribute to a deception but we may yet be faced with another inquiry simply because those who made the decisions naively thought only that they were trying to give the game a boost after three days of rain had killed this Test .
Lance Klusener , hitting whenever he got the chance so that his 61 came in 93 balls , and three partners , scored another 93 runs before the declaration and at lunch England were 16 without loss .
At that point they seemed on course for their target , but Hussain never got into his stride and was out just before tea caught by the diving Herschelle Gibbs at point .
