Judge defers hearing in Sharif case 

The judge hearing the case against the ousted Pakistani Prime Minister , Mr. Nawaz Sharif , today delayed for one day a decision on whether formal charges can be laid even though the prosecution has not handed over key evidence .
The case has dragged on in the courts for two months without formal charges being laid , and on Tuesday , Mr. Justice Jafri ordered the prosecution to take one of the lawyers representing the defence to Karachi airport to witness the copying of tapes made in the air control tower on the day of the alleged hijacking .
The chief prosecutor , Mr. Raja Qureshi , told the court the copying of the tapes would take time and that the laying of the charges did not have to wait until all the evidence was handed over , while the defence argued that a delay was needed because the tapes were so important .
` ` The recordings are of prime importance and unless these cassettes are provided to the accused the charges should not be framed,' ' Mr. Khwaja Sultan , one of the defence lawyers , told the court .
