Strike hits work in ports

Operations at 11 major ports across the country have been affected as the port and dock workers resorted to an indefinite strike as scheduled at midnight on Monday in response to the joint call given by five federations .
The strike , which became inevitable after the failure of the talks between the Union Surface Transport Minister , Mr. Rajnath Singh , and the federations ' representatives here , was said to be by and large peaceful .
The All-India Port and Dock Workers Union general secretary , Mr . Anthony Pillai , whose federation has put forth a common charter of demands , said that ` ` according to information available with us , the strike is 100 per cent successful .
The other two major demands pertain to the rate of House Rent Allowance and the date from which the HRA and City Compensatory Allowance would be payable .
Ironically , addressing his first press conference as the Central Minister , Mr. Rajnath Singh regretted that the labour representatives who were assured of a sympathetic consideration of the demands , had walked out of the talks with officials even without getting back to him .
The Centre of Indian Trade Union congratulated them for the ` ` successful strike' ' and condemned the Calcutta incident , claiming that 29 employees suffered injuries in the lathicharge by the CISF .
