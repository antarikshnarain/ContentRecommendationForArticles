The hijacking & international law

As the ICJ stressed in the American Hostages in Teheran case in 1980 , ` ` Wrongfully to deprive human beings of their freedom and to subject them to physical constraint in conditions of hardship is in itself manifestly incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well as with the fundamental principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
' ' Contemporary international law underscores the duty of every state to ( a ) prevent perpetration of terrorist acts against another state or against innocent individuals , and ( b ) consequently , to cooperate with other states in preventing and combating terrorism and in punishing terrorists .
Four multilateral treaties are directly relevant to aerial hijacking : ( 1 ) The Tokyo Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board the Aircraft , 1963 ; ( 2 ) The Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft , 1970 ; ( 3 ) The Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation , 1971 ; and ( 4 ) The International Convention against the Taking of Hostages , 1979 .
Second , the Convention , like other anti-terrorism conventions , recognises , explicitly or by necessary implications , the jurisdictional claims of at least seven categories of states : ( 1 ) the state where the aircraft is registered , ( 2 ) the state of the operator ( lessee ) of the aircraft , ( 3 ) the state in whose territory the aircraft lands with the alleged offender on board , ( 4 ) the state in whose territory the alleged offender is found , ( 5 ) the state in whose territory or in whose airspace the offence was committed , ( 6 ) the state whose national is the alleged offender , and ( 7 ) the state whose security is directly affected by the offence .
) Third , as a direct consequence of the possibility of competing jurisdictional claims , the Convention , for the first time in the history of treaty law , establishes a general obligation on any party state in whose territory the offender is found either to take measures to prosecute him or to extradite him .
Fifth , the Convention also imposes on a party state a number of important procedural obligations such as the duty to take the alleged offender into custody or to ensure his presence within its territory , the duty to hold an immediate preliminary inquiry into the facts of the offence , the duty to notify all relevant states of the detention of the offender , the duty to report to them the findings of the preliminary inquiry , where possible the duty to take all appropriate measures to restore control of the aircraft to its lawful commander , and the duty to return the aircraft and its cargo .
