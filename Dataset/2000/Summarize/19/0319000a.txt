Russian House opens with calls for unity

The new Russian Parliament opened its first session today with the acting President , Mr. Vladimir Putin , urging cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of Government and ruling out dictatorship in Russia .
` ` The executive power is prepared for fruitful cooperation with the new Duma,' ' Mr. Putin said in his address to the lower House , the State Duma , elected in December .
Communists and two Kremlin-backed parties control roughly 30 per cent of the State Duma 's 450 seats each , with the rest divided among another six groups , which are expected to ally either with Communists or the pro-Government parties on specific issues .
Mr. Putin , former head of the domestic security service , strongly rejected suggestions that following the election of a hung Parliament and snap presidential elections in March that he is heavily tipped to win , he would push Russia towards dictatorship .
However , Mr. Putin called for ` ` a policy of cooperation and mutually agreed restraints' ' by the Kremlin and Parliament and urged an end to ` ` the policy of confrontation and mutual ambitions .
