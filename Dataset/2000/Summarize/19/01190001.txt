Firm up look-east policy, Singapore tells India

Singapore today prompted India to reinforce its ` ` look-east policy' ' even as the two countries sought to expand their economic linkages and discussed ways to galvanise a global campaign against international terrorism .
I know India places importance to relations with the U.S. and Europe,' ' the Singapore Prime Minister , Mr. Goh Chok Tong , said soon after he was accorded a ceremonial welcome in the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan this morning .
Mr. Goh acknowledged that economic interaction between the two countries had slowed down of late , but attributed it to the South-East Asian economic meltdown .
` ` Our relations are very good but unfortunately because of the recent economic crisis in Asia , our contacts were slowed down and I am , therefore , here to strengthen our ties,' ' he said .
Most of these are funded by ( the ) drugs trade which is an equally deadly scourge of the last century which will continue in the new millennium if no serious collective action is taken to combat it .
Singapore played a key role in making India a full dialogue partner of the ASEAN as well as the member of the multilateral ASEAN Regional Forum ( ARF ) which looks at ways to enhance regional security .
