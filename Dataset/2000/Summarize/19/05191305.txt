Crucial Indo-Pak. issues

Sir , - Ms. Malini Parthasarathy 's thought-provoking interview with Gen. Pervez Musharraf ( TheHindu , Jan. 17 ) helps to put Indo- Pakistan relations in perspective and identify crucial issues .
Secondly , considering that he underplays the Shimla and Lahore declarations , arrived at by democratically-elected Prime Ministers from both sides , India 's doubts whether an agreement reached with the military Government will be acceptable to a future democratic set-up are understandable .
Thirdly , while the General admits to Pakistan 's sway over the ` ` mujahideen' ' ( in the context of their withdrawal from Kargil ) , he is obviously unwilling to use this influence over them to put an end to cross-border terrorism , one action which will earn him goodwill and credibility in India .
Partha Sarathy , Chennai Sir , - TheHindu and Ms. Malini Parthasarathy deserve our gratitude for having documented Pakistan 's version of the Kashmir dispute .
Thomas Edmunds , Chennai Sir , - Ms. Malini Parthasarathy 's interview , at a time when New Delhi-Islamabad relations are at their lowest ebb , enables the Indian people to know Pakistan 's point of view on the critical issues which have been exercising their minds ever since the General took charge as the Chief Executive .
Syed Gowher Ali , Chennai Although one does not concur with the General 's views on Pakistan 's involvement in the IA plane hijack and cross-border terrorism , one must agree with his argument how bilateral relations will improve considering India 's attitude of questioning the legitimacy of his regime and its consequent reticence to engage him diplomatically .
