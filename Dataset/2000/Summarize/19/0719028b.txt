Drama begins before curtain rises

The eleventh hour arrival of Ajay Jadeja has further sharpened the edge of this season 's Deodhar Trophy which gets underway here tomorrow with North Zone playing West Zone at the Municipal Stadium .
The domestic inter-zone one-day competition is usually a poor and forgotten cousin of the high-pitched international game , but with the National team playing poor and , indeed , forgettable cricket down under , this time things are a little different .
West Zone captain Nayan Mongia and former India skipper Mohammad Azharuddin ( who will lead South Zone versus West here on Saturday ) , are the other leading protagonists in the Deodhar Trophy drama which promises to throw up fresh dilemmas for the National selectors over the next few weeks .
The teams : North Zone : Vikram Rathour ( captain ) , Ashu Dani , Ajay Jadeja , Pankaj Dharmani , Dinesh Mongia , Mithun Minhas , Virender Sehwag , Vijay Dahiya , Amit Bhandari , Rahul Sanghvi , Robin Singh ( Jr ) , Sarandeep Singh , Rajiv Nayyar , Jasvir Singh and Surendra Singh .
West Zone : Nayan Mongia ( captain ) , Ajit Bhoite , Zahir Khan , Wasim Jaffer , Amol Muzumdar , Jatin Paranjpe , Vinod Kambli , Paras Mhambrey , Nilesh Kulkarni , Abhijit Kale , Iqbal Siddiqui , Sitanshu Kotak , Hitesh Parsanna and Nilesh Modi .
