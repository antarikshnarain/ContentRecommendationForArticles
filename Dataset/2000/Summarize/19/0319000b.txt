No need for U.N. probe, says Jakarta

Indonesia will ask the United Nations to desist from setting up an international tribunal to investigate the alleged role by Jakarta 's military officers in fomenting the recent carnage in East Timor , now under the global organisation 's protective umbrella prior to full independence in a few years .
Before leaving for New York , the Indonesian Foreign Minister , Mr . Alwi Shihab , said he would seek to brief the U.N. Secretary- General , Mr. Kofi Annan , on Indonesia 's ` ` credible' ' national human rights commission .
The move by Indonesia for ` ` internalising' ' the investigation of its military officers came as the President , Mr. Abdurrahman Wahid asserted that an army coup was not likely in the prevailing circumstances and that an attempt , if any , would be resisted through stern counter-measures .
An independent panel , entrusted with the task of bringing about reconciliation between the Muslims and Christians in Maluku , is reported to have discovered evidence of a possible link between the year-long communal violence in several places of the Spice Islands , including Ambon and some sections of the Indonesian armed forces .
But there was no authoritative confirmation of this as also the reported view of the reconciliation panel that the blame for the strife in the Spice Isles could even be traced up to the doorstep of Gen. Wiranto , presently the Senior Minister for Politics and Security Affairs and formerly chief commander of the combined Indonesian military forces .
