Chords & Notes

The other composer David Byrne , who once belonged to a band called Talking Heads , is one of the pioneers who explored the world music scene along with Peter Gabriel and Paul Simon .
There are still some great soul and pop divas who go on like Aretha Franklin , Tina Turner and Diana Ross .
If that classical piece was that good , then listen to the mujra , " Uran katola " , written by her that showcases a totally different aspect of her voice .
Another highlight is Jagjit Singh 's poignant ghazal , " Is Nagari Mein " that laments the loss of life following one of the worst ecological disasters in India .
To add beat and thump to the score is Lucky Ali , who belts out a pop number , " Tu kaun hai " while " Hum Kya Log Hai " by Sagarika , for which she herself has penned the words , is a slow , moody number .
Of the six tracks , " Kannae Kannae " ( Srinivas ) is a softer and slower number , while " Achacho Anarkali " ( Rohitraj , Febi ) is perhaps targetted at college goers !
