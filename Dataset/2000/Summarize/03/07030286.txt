Pakistan crashes to defeat 

In its chase Pakistan could score only 229 as Australia ` A ' skipper Shane Lee starred with the ball , taking four for 32 from six overs with his medium-pacers .
The game slipped out of Pakistan 's grasp early as Australia ` A ' openers Matthew Hayden ( 128 ) and David Fitzgerald ( 85 ) hit 191 as they mauled an attack which looked painfully innocuous without the lightning pace of Akhtar .
Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq saved Pakistan to some degree with 10 beautifully flighted overs which earned him five for 40 as the home team 's middle order and tail caved in .
In its big chase , Pakistan skidded to an embarrassing 82 for six in the 19th over before Mahmood and Abdur Razzak ( 35 ) injected some steel into the innings .
