True , the crisis was not of his making - its origin could be traced to the lapses of the Civil Aviation Ministry or the failure of internal security - but what about the subsequent embarrassment the country found itself in ?
His account of what happened at the Kathmandu airport that the hijackers had disembarked from a Pakistan International Airlines flight before they boarded the IA plane - denied by civil aviation officials - was seized upon by Pakistan to absolve itself of any involvement in the hijacking .

A statement by the European Union , though belated , rightly reiterated ` ` support for the combat against terrorism in all its forms , whatever its motives and origin' ' , calling it a threat to internal and international security , to peaceful relations between States .
Apart from the condemnation by the U.S. , E.U. , Russia and some others of this terrorist act - delayed in some cases - there was no evidence of their looking at the direction pointed by the needle of suspicion , besides substantive evidence .
