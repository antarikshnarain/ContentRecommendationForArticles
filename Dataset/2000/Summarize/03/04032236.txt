Hold trial daily against Jayalalitha: Janata Party

The Janata Party has urged the State Government to speed up the corruption cases pending against the AIADMK chief , Ms. Jayalalitha , in the special courts by holding the trial on a daily basis .
A resolution adopted to this effect at the State executive committee meeting of the party held here today , pointed out that the Prevention of Corruption Act favoured speedy trial on a day- to-day basis .
It was only after Ms. Chandralekha , president of the State unit of the party , presented a petition to the Chief Minister , pleading for steps for speeding up the cases , the Government wrote to the special courts for holding the trial daily .
The party adopted a new document on its agriculture policy and made a plea to the Government to declare agriculture as an industry and to extend all the concessions being extended to the industry to the agriculture sector .
Hence , the Government should set up airports even in small towns , create packaging , cold storage and other facilities with immediate effect .
Another resolution pointed out that on a public interest litigation filed by Dr. Subramanian Swamy , pleading for raising the height of the Periar Dam to 152 ft. from the present 136 ft. , the Supreme Court had given a direction to the Kerala Government to take steps to solve the issue and give its reply by February 12 .
