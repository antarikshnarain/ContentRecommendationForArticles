Suicide bombers 'identified' 

The suicide bombers suspected to be behind the December 18 twin explosions - one of which was an attempt to assassinate the Sri Lankan President - Ms. Chandrika Kumaratunga , are reported to have been identified .
While Niro 's attempt on Ms. Kumaratunga failed , the other suicide bomber , identified as 25-year old Sukkath , killed the former Army Chief of Staff , Maj. Gen. ( Retd ) Lucky Alagama , at an election rally organised by the Opposition United National Party ( UNP ) at Ja-Ela , a Colombo suburb , on the same night .
Sukkath is said to have belonged to the 18th batch of Black Tigers trained in the Iranamadu jungles in the Vanni and was recruited by an LTTE intelligence cadre from the eastern Trincomalee district .
The names of these officers have been included in a secret interim report to the Defence Ministry , the daily said , adding that in the case of the blast at the UNP meet , ` ` political considerations' ' had led to the selection of a ` ` less secure venue .
The Foreign Ministry was enquiring into reports that the youths carrying false papers were held recently at Astrakhan airport with intentions to visit Dagestan , near Chechnya , where the Russian army is conducting a military campaign to crush Muslim rebels .
