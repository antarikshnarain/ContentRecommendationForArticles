And the show went on... 

And naturally , the " thalaivars " , " thondars " and " rasigars " had come to join her to appreciate their " Dalapathi " .
It was over three hours of Rajni , Latha , Rajni , Latha and more Rajni and more Latha .
In his fluid ensemble replete with sudden leg thrusts , knee flexions , pelvic lunges , march-like swaggering and gliding torso movements , Prabhu Deva brought alive the irrepressible vitality of dance .
What stood out amidst the staple speeches by the Chief Minister Mr. M . Karunanidhi , TMC chief G. K. Moopanar , K. Balachander , Shatrughan Sinha , Ambarish and Mohan Babu was that of Rajni 's .
In his vivid style the superstar said that his was not a " saekra kootam " ( assembled crowd ) but a " thaana saerugira kootam " ( crowd that comes on its own ) and that he knew how to " vasool " ( collect ) and also pay back .
And the show went on... No matter the menacing mosquitoes and cough-provoking cold , the fans stayed on... till it ended with the new singing sensation Latha Rajnikanth 's " Bharatam " .
