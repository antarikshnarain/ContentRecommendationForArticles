Defeat at Kandahar - I 

All that the world has are conflicting claims , by India - that four of them came from Pakistan on a PIA flight the same day and were smuggled into the IA flight 's departure lounge , and by Pakistan - that they were Sikh and Hindu militants whom it had nothing to do with .
After Captain Dev Sharan had fooled the hijackers into thinking that he was desperately low on fuel and had to land in Amritsar , why did the hijackers suddenly decide to force him to take off even as a fuel tanker was on its way to refuel the plane ?
Even if it took off from Dubai without permission to land in Kandahar , the Taliban was not obliged on humanitarian grounds to let it do so for the plane now had all the fuel it needed to fly to a dozen destinations .
Even after the plane landed in Kandahar , why was the Taliban so distinctly cool to the hijackers , threatening even to storm the plane if they killed any more passengers , but end up as their protectors , forbidding an Indian commando assault and throwing a protective cordon around the plane ?
But the Taliban was either not available in time , were slow to decide what they wanted to do , or were sufficiently annoyed by Pakistan freezing their bank accounts and arresting a key Taliban aide , to make them beg for favours .
Captain Dev Sharan undoubtedly saved the passengers ' lives by forcing a touchdown at the airport , but thereafter it is a fairly sure bet that it was serious pressure from Pakistan , and perhaps an assurance from the Taliban , that made Dubai allow the plane to take off a third time .
