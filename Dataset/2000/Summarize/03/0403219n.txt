NGOs keep cyclone survivors' hopes alive

Visiting the worst-hit blocks of Ersama , Balikuda , Astaranga and Gobindapur one feels that much more could have been done during the past two months had there been proper coordination between the Government and the voluntary sector .
` ` A collaborative policy framework between the State Government and the NGOs should have been in place by now for the reconstruction and restoration work in the cyclone-hit districts,' ' Mr. Jagadananda of the Centre for Youth and Social Development ( CYSD ) , a prominent Bhubaneswar-based NGO working in the affected areas said .
' ' Even though the State Government has not started its ` food for work ' schemes in the cyclone-ravaged districts so far , the CYSD is constructing an earthen embankment on the river Alka in Goteswarpur village of Balikuda block of Jagatsinghpur under its ` food for work ' programme .
With no support from the authorities , the CYSD volunteers have been able to motivate over 500 people from as many as 20 nearby villages in addition to scores of volunteers from outside the State to construct the check dam .
Several other NGOs such as the Lutheran World Service , Bharat Gyan Bharati and Utkal Bipanna Sahayata Samiti are also at work in the region and are organising ` food for work ' programmes for reconstruction and repair of village roads , cleaning of village ponds , putting up temporary shelters for primary schools etc .
As everything is taking time on the Government 's side , the people , whose houses have been completely damaged by the high- speed gale or washed away by the tidal waves , are not sure whether they would get assistance to build proper houses before the coming monsoon .
