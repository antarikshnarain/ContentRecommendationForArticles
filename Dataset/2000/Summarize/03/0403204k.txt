Adequate Central forces for Bihar Assembly polls sought 

Even as the Election Commission directed the Union Home Ministry to adequately deploy Central forces at least one month ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar , the State Government too has placed its demand with the Centre for sending at least 800 companies of para-military forces for maintaining law and order during the polls .
By their action both the EC and the State Government have obviously sought to take pre-emptive measure to avoid the embarrassment they had to face during the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections , thanks to the action of the then Acting Governor .
The former Governor , Mr. B. M. Lal , the then Chief Justice of the Patna High Court , had shot off a letter to the Union Home Ministry immediately after the first round of elections that left 38 police and civil personnel dead , in which he expressed his displeasure over the failure of the EC to ensure proper security arrangement which he held as responsible for these killings .
The State Government , likewise , has taken the plea that it needed at least 800 companies of para-military forces to tackle the naxalite menace and the ISI threat perception which have hogged the limelight in the wake of the hijacking of the Indian Airlines aircraft from Kathmandu .
While the MCC might have stepped up its attacks in view of the approaching Assembly elections , the PWG , which too is opposed to the elections , has gone on the offensive to avenge the killings of its three top leaders in Andhra Pradesh .
Adding to the State Government 's worries was the recent call given by the Ranbir Sena , the private army of upper caste feudal Bhumihars , threatening to avenge the Senari carnage in which 35 Bhumihars were killed by the MCC .
