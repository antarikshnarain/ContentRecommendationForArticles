Britain not to block entry of released militant

Britain will not refuse entry to Islamic militant Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh , who was among the three militants released by India in exchange for the freedom of 155 hostages on board the hijacked Indian Airlines plane .
Meanwhile , sources said Sheikh was unlikely to come to Britain immediately as he might be extradited from here in the event of a court in India convicting him in cases connected with terrorism .
