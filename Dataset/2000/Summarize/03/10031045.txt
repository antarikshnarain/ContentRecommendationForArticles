dated January 3, 1950: ''No'' to reunion of India and Pakistan

The Prime Minister , Pandit Nehru , said in Nagpur , on January 1 , at a public meeting that ` ` to talk of bringing about a reunion of India and Pakistan at the present juncture is meaningless .
' ' Pandit Nehru said that at the recent Calcutta session of the Hindu Mahasabha , the President of the Sabha , had made a statement that the objective of the Sabha was to strive for the reunion of India and Pakistan into ` ` Akhand Bharat .
He deplored that for sometime past fresh attempts were being made in India by some people to rouse communal feelings of Hindus and make them look at the problems facing this land from what he called ` ` a narrow and restricted' ' approach .
