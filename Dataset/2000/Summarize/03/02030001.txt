BJP giving up swadeshi plank?

The Bharatiya Janata Party has all but tossed out its ` swadeshi ' economic plank as it makes haste to transform itself to suit its new role as a ` ` natural party of governance .
' ' As the main opposition party , if it had stalled reforms in the insurance sector and prevented the Narasimha Rao Government from legislating to allow foreign investment , now the BJP is asking for ` ` speeding up of reforms in insurance , banking and other financial areas' ' to help reduce the cost of capital for Indian industry and business .
The Chennai Declaration of the BJP , adopted on December 29 , is virtually a hymn to ` Manmohanomics ' - restrict government role , remove all unnecessary controls on industry , use the disinvestment route for a speedy reduction in national debt , rationalise subsidies , and go for financial sector reforms .
But now , the party has asked for speedy disinvestment to be carried out with care and transparency to quickly reduce national debt and free resources for investment in the social sector , the same prescription Dr. Man Mohan Singh had recommended for the sick economy .
The only concession to ` swadeshi ' economics in the Chennai Declaration was a reference to the need for implementing schemes for ` ` cattle wealth protection' ' , another way of saying that cow slaughter should be banned and more cowsheds should be built .
