The millennium babies 

The arrival of a baby is definitely a joyous occasion , but when two babies were born in the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology ( IOG ) , Egmore , last night , there was more than the usual reasons for celebration .
Consequently , the mothers too became ` millennium mothers ' and froze under the unfamiliar glare of camera lights .
We are mostly wondering where the next meal will come from , so it is difficult to dream for the child,' ' says Ms. Usha , the mother of the female baby .
While at the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women , Triplicane , a 2.6 kg female baby was born to Ms . Jothylakshmi and Mr. Dhanasekhar at 12-01 a.m. , a healthy male baby weighing 3.3 kgs , was born in the IOG at 12-05 a.m . At a private hospital on AVM Avenue in Virgambakkam , a male child was born through normal delivery at 12-18 a.m. to Mrs Vennila Parandaman .
