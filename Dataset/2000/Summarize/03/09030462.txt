The " Pranava Ghanta " ( Om Bell ) forms part of a stunning range of musical instruments displayed at the Development Centre for Musical Instruments ( Sangita Vadyalaya ) , Office of the Development Commissioner ( Handicrafts ) , Government of India , at 759 , Anna Salai .
The whole scale of melody and rhythm is traversed from the Tata Vadyas ( stringed instruments ) , to the Sushira vadyas ( wind instruments ) , the Avanaddha ( skin covered ) to the Ghana vadhyas ( solid and weighty , made of metal or wood ) .
The Makara Yazh with the head of an alligator and canine body and limbs , the Senkottu Yazh shaped like a boat as also the Sagoda Yazh , and the Periyazh also known as Paravai Yazh .
Among the rare musical instruments recreated here are the fish- shaped stringed instrument , the Matsya veena , the versatile Pancha Vadyan , the cobra shaped and the stone Nagaswaram .
The Vamsee Sruthi made from bamboo , the Sruthi dandi fashioned from wood and the Vamsee Sruthi dandi which is made of a combination of wood and bamboo were researched and developed under the guidance of Director T. Lokanadha Sarma in the late Seventies .
Experimentation in the materials used have resulted in novel items such as the bamboo splinters veena , the red cedar and the cane splinters one where the Kodam is made from splinters of the material mentioned rather than the traditional jackwood .
