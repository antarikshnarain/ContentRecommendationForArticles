Barak has ace up his sleeve?

The Israeli Prime Minister , Mr. Ehud Barak will today lead his delegation for talks with Syria scheduled to start tomorrow at a venue in Sheperdstown , in the State of West Virginia , U.S .
The talks are expected to commence with separate meetings between Mr. Barak and the U.S. President , Mr. Bill Clinton on the one hand and between the U.S. Secretary of State , Ms. Madeleine Albright and the Syrian Foreign Minister , Mr. Farooq al Sharaa on the other .
According to a report in the Israeli daily Haaretz , Mr. Barak will be carrying a copy of a letter that shows that his predecessor , Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu was ready to withdraw from the Golan Heights .
The letter was purportedly written to the U.S . President , Mr. Bill Clinton by a U.S. businessman , Mr. Ron Lauder who was carrying back-channel contacts with Syria on behalf of Mr. Netanyahu .
Such a formulation falls short of the Syrian demand that Israel withdraw to the June 1967 border because a portion of the territory thus claimed was , according to Israel , not under Syrian sovereignty at the relevant point of time .
''Peace with Syria has a very painful and very hard price , but it is necessary , ` ` he said a few hours before he was due to leave for the U.S . Mr. Barak said he was convinced that peace with Syria would be approved by a ''large majority ` ` of Israelis in a promised referendum on any deal .
