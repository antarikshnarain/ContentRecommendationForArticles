No relief in sight for Indian team 

The bottom line is , apart from Sachin Tendulkar - the lone , shining exception - nobody in this team seems to possess the talent required to play the quick stuff .
Quite apart from the fact that the team gets bowled out for low totals , what is alarming is the manner in which the batsmen are getting out .
Prasad did manage to last 10 overs , but he was getting beaten almost every ball and McGrath , visibly frustrated , was scratching his head in dismay before the Indian wicketkeeper nicked one to Mark Waugh .
If he is unable to come to terms with fast bowling from McGrath and Brett Lee , then it only goes to show that he lacks confidence more than anything else .
But , then , in the last few weeks in Australia I have seen many of our top batsmen score runs in similar fashion and we have also got a lot of runs from leg byes .
But the gap between Tendulkar and the rest is widening more and more even as it becomes obvious that it would be ridiculous to expect the captain to score a century each time he goes out to bat .
