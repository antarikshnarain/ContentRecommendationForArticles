Costly freedom 

Sir , - As you have rightly pointed out in the Editorial ( Jan. 1 ) , the Government has paid a heavy price for getting the hostages aboard the hijacked Indian Airlines plane released .
The Government has succumbed to threats despite the Prime Minister 's earlier stance that it would not be cowed down - all because of its inept handling of the crisis right from the time the aircraft first landed at Amritsar .
The Government must keep a close watch on the movements of the freed hijackers and terrorists , and see that they are captured and brought to book .
