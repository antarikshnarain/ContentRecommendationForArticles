Shift in S.Africa's policy on Western Sahara? 

' ' Describing the new century as ` ` Africa 's century of hope,' ' Mr . Mbeki , in his nationwide broadcast over radio and T.V. , said South Africans could take pride in the fact that the 20th century saw an end to the system of colonialism and white minority rule in the continent ` ` except for the unresolved matter of Western Sahara .
When Morocco attained independence in March 1956 , the then Spanish protectorate of Western Sahara , itself a territory of contention between Morocco and Mauritania , did not automatically revert to either of these countries .
A tripartite agreement involving Spain , Morocco and Mauritania in November 1975 effectively partitioned the territory between Morocco and Mauritania - leading to the setting of an in exile Government of the Saharawi Republic in Algeria by Polisario , the liberation movement founded in 1973 which has been fighting for self- determination .
The conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Polisario by Mauritania and the withdrawal of Mauritania from its part of Western Sahara led to Morocco occupying the whole territory in 1979 .
Indeed , despite its commitment to a referendum , Morocco has not returned to the OAU from which it walked out following the admission of a Western Saharan delegation to take part in the OAU summit at Addis Ababa in November 1984 .
A joint statement issued in July 1988 by the late Oliver Tambo , then President of the ANC ( with whom Mr. Mbeki worked closely during his years of exile ) , and Mr. Mohamed Abdel Aziz , secretary-general of the Polisario and President of the Saharawi Republic , ` ` paid warm tributes to the freedom fighters of South Africa and the Saharawi Republic for their valiant and determined fight against the racist regime of South Africa and the expansionist Moroccans .
