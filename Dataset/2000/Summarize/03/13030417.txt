Strumming a message

The songs are purely a manifestation of the realities that are staring at our faces - clean water growing scarcer , forests dwindling , marine mammals declining , indigenous human population disappearing , the fisheries collapsing , protein shortages emerging , productive topsoil diminishing , contamination by pesticides and industrial chemicals steadily growing , species loss accelerating , chronic diseases rising throughout the industrialised world... this list only brushes the surfaces .
A meeting of minds led to the idea of doing a show with specially written songs in Bombay and China - Nityanand Jayaraman , Asia Toxics Campaigner of Greenpeace met John Antony , a member of the music group The Banned through Vinayan of The School , and requested him to do a show to express solidarity with the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy .
" The wind powered Rainbow Warrior has a long and rich history of international campaigns for environmental justice - the very name Rainbow Warrior was inspired by a North American Indian legend which prophesies that when man destroys the world through greed the warriors of the rainbow will arise to save it .
Four groups will be participating in the specially organised show at IIT-Earth Born with its acoustic music features Mahesh , Sajini , Jagdeesh Madhuri and Joy ; Oh God , another Madras-based group which says that it does simple music very seriously and serious music very simply - features Mridula , Shudeep , Sundar and Tabla Mani .
Thermal And A Quarter , a Bangalore-based rock group features Rzhude ( Rudy ) Bruce and Rajeev ; and The Banned with its new age compositions and melodies features Shudeep , Rzhude , Shuba , Keith , Eugene , Biju , Ramachandran , Rainer , Arun Rasjamani and John Antony .
None of these groups is looking for any personal glory - all of them are in it out of concern and the care they would like to express for the destruction of the planet earth - the world was created beautiful let us save and protect it - is their message through music - With a little help from everybody Yes it 's all about little helps really About cleaning up our act , basically It 's all about training the little fellow on waste disposal About teaching the motorists the need for pollution free roads About making the industrialists aware of the need for a pollution free environment It 's about giving mother earth the due respect It 's about treating people as the end itself Yes it 's all about CARING CHITRA MAHESH -
