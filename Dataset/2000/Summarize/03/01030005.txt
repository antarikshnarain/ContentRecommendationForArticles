Leopard trapped in house 

A leopard walked into an aged couple 's house in Faridabad early this morning , creating panic among residents .
Experts believe that the leopard could have jumped on a moving truck last night from the nearby ridge area and reached Faridabad where it was looking for a safe place to hide .
The five-year-old male leopard , weighing about 100 kg , will be treated at the Zoo Hospital before it is formally made a member of the wildlife here .
The drama began unfolding at the residence of retired IPS officer Mr. Prem Mehra , when he along with his wife , Mrs. Pampa Mehra , came out of their house on hearing a commotion .
After thorough checking , the officials , armed with a tranquilliser gun and a lathi , bolted the rooms to restrict the movement of the leopard .
When it was ensured that the animal was in the bathroom , they placed a cage in front of the bathroom door so that in case the leopard made an attempt to escape , it would be trapped .
