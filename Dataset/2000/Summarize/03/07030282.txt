Glenn McGrath cautioned 

SYDNEY , JAN 2.Glenn McGrath is learnt to have got away with a mere caution for his misconduct after getting Sachin Tendulkar leg-before on the opening day of the third Test at the SCG here on Sunday .
Nothing could have driven home the point more than this judgement by Match Referee , Mr. Ranjan Madugalle , who had fined Venkatesh Prasad 35 per cent of his match fee in the last Test at Melbourne , that there are different yardsticks for different people even if the degree of the offence might have been the same .
Tendulkar ignored the ill-tempered bowler but that the Match Referee too opted to adopt a similar approach would hardly amuse the Indians who have been at the receiving end in this series , particularly from the Australian umpires .
Even though it was Zimbabwean umpire , Mr. Ian Robinson who handed the Indian skipper a decision which was debatable all the way , there was no doubt that the Match Referee too had an equal role to perform in giving the home players an impression that they could get away with anything on the field .
He had been spoken to after his cap- snatching incident at Adelaide from umpire Mr. Steve Dunne after he had rightly called a ` ` wide' ' , a fact which McGrath did not relish and kept mouthing unprintable stuff .
Fined for excessive appealing , fined for charging at the umpire , fined for looking at the umpire were some of the reasons why some Indian players were penalised .
