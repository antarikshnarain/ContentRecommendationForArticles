'Kathmandu airport was like a bus stand'

Scenes of jubilation were witnessed on Sunday in the house of the seven passengers hailing from Vellore district who were aboard the hijacked IC 814 Kathmandu-Delhi plane , following their safe return from the seven-day ordeal .
In fact , he and his friends , on boarding the plane were discussing the ` ` total lack of security' ' and saying that it would be easy for any armed terrorist to get into the plane unchecked and hijack it .
Mr. Kulasekharan of Chinnanganallur village near Anaicut said that he and other able-bodied persons were hustled into the cabin and beaten up immediately after the hijack in order to strike terror into their minds and prevent them from offering resistance to the hijackers .
Mr. Dhanasekhar was all praise for Dr. Anitha Joshy , an Indian doctor among the passengers who provided treatment to the sick inside the plane , along with a French doctor and an Indian male doctor , in the light of the refusal of the hijackers to allow any medical team from outside to enter the plane .
Mr. V. Perumal , who was not present during the press conference , told this reporter at his house that their experience was akin to being in an intensive care unit of a hospital , with the hostages starved of food for a full 24 hours when the hijackers were informed about a deadlock in the talks .
Asked whether he thought that the Government was right in releasing the three terrorists from jails , as demanded by the hijackers , Mr. Dhanasekhar justified the Government move saying that it would have been criminal to have allowed the innocent hostages to be killed for no fault of theirs by refusing to yield to the demands of the hijackers .
