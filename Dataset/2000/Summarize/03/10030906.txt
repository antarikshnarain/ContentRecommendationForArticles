God is the ultimate authority

The Vedas and the Upanishads say that God is not biased in giving joy or grief but He provides results according to our deeds .
By having performed meritorious acts , a person gets noble birth and by his wicked acts , he is born as a sinner .
Sri Pramukh Swami Maharaj , in a discourse , said that a man who indulges in evil acts daringly , may seem to be happy at present but eventually he will have to face the consequences .
But if the container is filled with bad products , after those at the lower level are exhausted , the grains on the upper layer will flow .
But the Swami explained that in her previous birth , she was from a high caste about which she was proud and arrogant and she showed aversion to other devotees who were not as lucky as she was .
God or His messengers can intervene in deserving cases and save such penitents from excruciating pain caused by impalement , replacing it by a mere prick of a thorn .
