Of false leads and half-truths 

Astrologers may claim that they saw it coming ( with hindsight they always do ) and nobody may sit down , in the fashion of John Reed , to write ` ` Seven Days that Shook India'' .
In far less trying circumstances , Ghalib had lamented that God had n't been fair to him saying : ` ` Zindagi apni kuch is shakl se guzri Ghalib , hum bhi kya yaad karenge ke Khuda rakhte the' ' ( thanks to the twists and turns my life has been through , I 'll always remember that there is a God to contend with ) .
And again : ` ` Hum kahan ke daana the , kis hunar me yakta the besabad hua Ghalib dushman aasman apna' ' ( I am not the wisest of men , so why is God so jealous and unjust to me ) .
The TV images of men , women and politicos visiting places of worship and attending all-religion prayers were chilling reminders of human vulnerability , reinforcing the view that when the chips are really down , there is only one hope : the God up there .
The domestic electronic media may have missed out on reporting first-hand the ` ` final' ' act , but for much of the week it worked overtime to keep viewers glued to television screens .
Occasionally , it overreached itself , made mistakes as competing TV channels stepped on each other 's toes to be the first with the news , and carried the ` ` talking heads' ' syndrome to the point of boredom but in the end it did keep people informed .
