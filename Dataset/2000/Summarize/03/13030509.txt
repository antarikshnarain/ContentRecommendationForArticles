Quest of a different kind 

If the collector has a trove of pictorial calendars , what better time to show them off than the New Year festive period , when people are at their attentive best .
A yen for the unusual has led Mr. K. Ramakrishnan , an employee at the Patent Office , to scout for old pictorial calendars , a variant on stamp collectors .
Dismissed by some as a maverick , he says he has managed to set up a collection of 10,000 to 12,000 calendars .
More than 80 per cent of his collection are Indian calendars , 30 per cent of which portray Indian Gods and Goddesses .
He has a good number of overseas calendars too from countries such as the U.K. , the U.S. , New Zealand , Australia , Japan , Germany , Sweden , France , Korea , a couple of African countries and some from the Middle East .
The artists who toiled to prepare the illustrations on the calendars are not given their due recognition , the collector laments .
