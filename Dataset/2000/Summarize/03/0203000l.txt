A sell-out: Swamy 

The Janata Party came down heavily on the BJP-led NDA Government at the Centre for releasing three hardcore terrorists in exchange for over 150 hostages of the hijacked IA plane and said it was a ` ` sell-out of national interests and abject surrender before the fundamentalists .
' ' The resolution said the Centre was duty-bound to explain to the people why the Prime Minister had failed to consider alternative options and was from the beginning insistent on releasing the terrorists .
The party 's district units will hold demonstrations in front of the Collectorates shortly to condemn the ` ` sellout' ' and demanded Mr . Vajpayee 's resignation .
