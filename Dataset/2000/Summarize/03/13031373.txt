There is so much more information and knowledge , not only generated , but also available and accessible at the touch of a key ; there are so many more people competing for the rapidly dwindling natural resources ( energy , materials , water... ) of the planet ; there is a host of environmental problems ( global warming , ozone depletion ; air and water pollution ; solid waste disposal... ) to be tackled ; 'jobless growth ' worldwide ; escalating aspirations fuelled by technological advances and media hype ; widening gap and disparities between different strata of society ; erosion of values ; and so on .
The role of Technology in enhancing the creation and delivery of Education is just beginning to be exploited , while the role of life-long learning to provide just- in-time education has been well-recognised .
Prof. A. Kalanidhi , Vice-Chancellor , Anna University , wishes that youngsters , with the amazing Information Technology to aid them would help make our country a super power .
And insofar as Anna University is concerned , it will offer services in human resource training and render the much needed support for growth in R and D , in various areas of work .
