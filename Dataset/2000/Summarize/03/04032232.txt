PMK resents invitation to Dheeran 

Speculation is rife in political circles that the Pattali Makkal Katchi ( PMK ) , an ally of the ruling DMK , is cut up over the latter 's invitation extended to Mr.Dheeran , leader of the Tamil Pattali Makkal Kazhagam ( TPMK ) , to attend the unveiling function of the Thiruvalluvar statue held at Kanyakumari on Saturday .
Relationship between the DMK and PMK is said to be already under strain after the Government ordered a CB-CID inquiry into the recent attack on the Vanniyar Sangham president , Mr.A.K.Natarajan , at his T.Nagar residence .
