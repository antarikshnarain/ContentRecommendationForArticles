A pyrrhic victory

A zealot of the calibre of Maulana Masood Azhar can motivate and train hundreds of militants , putting in peril the lives of thousands of our countrymen , not to speak of the safety of our vital strategic installations and ammunition dumps .
Well- experienced men in the security forces and the army who had successfully grappled with militants and hijacks were ignored .
R. Rajaraman , Chennai * * * Sir , - Needless to say , the security staff at the Tribhuvan International Airport goofed up their assignment .
As one who went through the rigmarole of security checks at various airports , I believe that the security staff concerned are party to the crime , more than being guilty of lapses .
Mr. Brijesh Mishra , Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister , needs to be given a Nobel Prize for the most innovative remark about the situation when he said ` the hijackers obviously belong to a terrorist outfit' .
The author suggests employment of specially trained operators who can break the backbone of terrorist organisations , which job even whole armies can not and should not be expected to do .
