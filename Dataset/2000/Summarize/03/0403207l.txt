Chautala may find it tough in mid-term poll 

The Chief Minister and Indian National Lok Dal supremo , Mr. Om Prakash Chautala , may find the going tough and he may well rue his decision to force an election 18 months before the due date .
And the people particularly the jats and the ryots , who are regarded as the traditional supporters of the Devi Lal clan , are not being taken in by the so-called ` Janata Darbars ' being held by Mr. Chautala almost daily across the State .
A farmer in a village near this district town said bluntly : ` ` We never expected the Government to give us free power but Mr. Chautala should fulfil his promise made before he became Chief Minister that the arrears of electricity bills should be waived off'' .
Moreover , there is resentment among lower and middle rungs of the INLD that Mr. Chautala may be pressurised into giving more seats to the Bharatiya Janata Party as this would spoil their chances of getting party nominations .
They are not going to take any ` impositions ' lightly and their mood indicates that they may even defy Mr. Chautala 's edicts if they find them ` unpalatable' .
Mr. Chautala has indicated that he would not succumb to any pressure from the BJP regarding allotment of seats and he has also ruled out creation of the Deputy Chief Minister 's post for the BJP in the future set-up .
