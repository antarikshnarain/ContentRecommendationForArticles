'Hijackers collected Rs. 71,000 for gift to Taliban'

Perhaps this is what prompted them to urge the passengers to collect money for making a gold-plated model of a plane with ` ` Indian Airlines IC-814' ' inscribed on it for installation at a Kandahar museum .
On the night of December 30 , the most popular of the hijackers , Burger , told the passengers that 80 per cent of the negotiations had been finalised with the Indian Government .
Stating that all the deals were being put on paper , he told the passengers that in all probability , ` ` with God 's grace' ' , they would be free the following morning .
` ` After people made various suggestions , he opined that we should rather give them a model of the Indian Airlines plane , a gold-plated one at that .
' ' Then two passengers were chosen by Burger who handed them Rs 20,000 for getting such a model prepared .
This Nepali passenger , who works for a non-governmental organisation in Afghanistan and is based in Peshawar , Pakistan , was instructed to carry the plane model to Afghanistan and get it installed in a museum .
