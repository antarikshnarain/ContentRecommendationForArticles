The Sri Lankan presidential poll 

The Sri Lankan Army would suffer serious reverses in Elephant Pass ; there would be a blood bath in Colombo following the LTTE 's attacks on Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga and the UNP rally at Ja Ela ; and the new President would be forced to follow a Sinhala chauvinist line , exacerbating the ethnic conflict .
What is more , in her first policy statement soon after assuming office for a second term , Mrs. Kumaratunga called upon the people ` ` to unite and fight against the forces of hatred and terror' ' , reaffirmed her determination to usher in ` ` peace and reconciliation' ' and made a special appeal to the leader of the Opposition , Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe , to ` ` cooperate' ' with her and play a major role in the common effort ` ` to forge a new Sri Lanka of tranquillity and tremendous opportunity'' .
During the second Eelam war , Maj. Gen. Alagama became the Commander of the Armed Forces in the East ; under army pressure , the Tigers were forced to withdraw from that region and concentrate on the Jaffna peninsula .
By killing Maj. Gen . Alagama , Mr. Prabakaran simultaneously sent two messages : ( 1 ) The LTTE would never forgive anyone who tried to tame the Tigers ; and ( 2 ) A warning to Mr. Wickremesinghe that he would meet the same fate if , after becoming President , he tried to cross swords with the LTTE .
For , 18.43 per cent of the postal ballots were for the JVP ; 38.93 per cent were in favour of the UNP and 40.74 per went to the PA. After the attempt on Mrs. Kumaratunga 's life , many JVP followers voted for her .
In his Heroes Day message , Mr. Prabakaran singled out Mrs. Kumaratunga for a vitriolic attack and characterised her five-year rule as ` ` the worst form of tyrannical oppression' ' and ` ` curse on the Tamil people .
