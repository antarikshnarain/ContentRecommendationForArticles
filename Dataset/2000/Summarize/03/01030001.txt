India ready to back claim on Pak. role

If the Government can indeed demonstrate that the footprints on the Christmas-eve hijacking of the Indian passenger aircraft are Pakistan 's , it can salvage something from the hostage crisis and gain worldwide support for its war against terrorism .
There has been considerable negative reaction to the incredulous attempts in Pakistan , for example , over the last week to portray the hijacking as a ` ` plot' ' by Indian intelligence agencies to ` ` defame' ' Pakistan .
India 's charges on the Pakistani aggression during the Kargil crisis gained considerable international credibility when the Government released the tapes of conversations between Gen . Pervez Musharraf , then Army chief , who was travelling in China , and his deputy , at Rawalpindi in late May 1999 .
While Pakistan claims that it only provides ` ` moral and diplomatic support' ' for the militant groups like the HUM , the U.S. has asserted that Pakistan provides them ` ` material support'' .
In a testimony to the U.S. Senate in November , Ambassador Michael A. Sheehan summed up the facts on Pakistan 's support to terrorist groups , in particular the HUM .
` ` Within the territory of Pakistan,' ' Mr. Sheehan said , ` ` there are numerous Kashmiri separatist groups and sectarian groups involved in terrorism which use Pakistan as a base .
