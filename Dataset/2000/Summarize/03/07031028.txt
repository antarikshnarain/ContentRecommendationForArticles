Gold Flake Open: All eyes on Kafelnikov 

Of the three listed passengers , tennis lovers would readily recognise one name - Yevgeny Kafelnikov , the top seed at the Gold Flake Open beginning here on Monday and 1999 Australian Open champion .
But , then , before we get carried away by the glitz and glory of modern tennis starring the likes of Kafelnikov , Cedric Pioline and Carlos Moya , the top three players in this year 's Gold Flake Open , let 's get one thing straight .
The unassuming visitors of the 1950s and 1960s , from Mottram down to Jack Arkinstall , Barry MacKay , Neale Fraser and Roy Emerson , might not have made tens of millions from the game but as skilled competitors they were as good - if not better - than the Kafelnikovs and the Moyas .
Take away the commercial mask of the game , forget about the mega- bucks and about all the hype too that surrounds most things sport...and when you scratch the surface , you know it is still very , very simple - it 's about men competing against each other on a public stage and striving for excellence .
And the Gold Flake Open itself is no different from a South India championship of another era featuring such giants as Fraser , Krishnan and Co . After all , when you knock off all the superficialities , a tennis tournament is a tennis tournament .
The young man Paes has been practising with here this week , the 16-year old National hardcourt champion Sunil Kumar , into the main draw on a wild card , has drawn a resurgent Ronald Agenor of Chile , a man who was first ranked by the ATP computer a year before Sunil Kumar was born .
