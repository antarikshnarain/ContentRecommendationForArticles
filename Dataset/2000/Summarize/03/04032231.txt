A testimony to TMC leader's goodwill: CM 

A gift presented to the Chief Minister , Mr . M. Karunanidhi , by the TMC president , Mr. G. K. Moopanar , on the occasion of the unveiling of the statue of Tiruvalluvar at Kanyakumari on Saturday night became a subject of political speculation .
Mr. Karunanidhi , who was surprised by the title of the gift- wrapped English book , ` You Can Win ' , said he could understand what was in the mind of his former political ally , Mr. Moopanar , and gave an assurance to realise it .
The Chief Minister said the standing ovation requested by Mr . Moopanar for the achievement of getting the statue installed at the confluence of three seas was a testimony to the goodwill nurtured by the TMC leader towards him .
He referred to the ` ` blacking out' ' of his initiative in the construction of the ` Valluvar Kottam ' in Chennai for 13 years for political reasons and said his Government , on the contrary , would ensure that the foundation stone laid during the regime of the late MGR would also be installed at the Tiruvalluvar statue here .
