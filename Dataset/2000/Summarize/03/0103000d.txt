Why Zargar's release was sought 

Including the former chief of Al Umar Mujahideen , Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar , in the list of militants whose release was demanded by the hijackers of Indian Airlines flight is significant in many ways .
In what is seen as a rejuvenated effort to involve Kashmiris in the ` ` armed struggle' ' more effectively , the as yet unidentified hijackers but said to be from the Pan-Islamic group Harkatul Mujahideen which , however , has denied involvement - asked for Zargar , the most wanted militant commander in the early days of militancy .
` ` How can I feel glad as now he is far away from my eyes and heart,' ' Ms. Salima , the 60-year-old widow told a local newspaper .
However , it is not ruled out that the planners behind the hijack might have sought his ( Zargar 's ) approval much earlier through his relatives and friends who would meet him in the jail .
' ' But it is also a fact that Zargar would not know any of the militant organisations such as the Harkat-ul-Ansar or Lashkar-i-Taiba , which came into existence much after his arrest .
Authorities here feel that there is an attempt across the border to get all those militant leaders who are in Pakistan-Occupied- Kashmir and Pakistan under one roof and devise new strategies and for that Mushtaq Zargar is certainly a ` ` big catch .
