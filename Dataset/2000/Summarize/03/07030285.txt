New Zealand 's best bowling came from left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori , who gave away only 28 runs and took one wicket in his full complement of 10 overs .
New Zealand started sedately , but exploded in the sixth over when Astle and craig Spearman helped themselves to 15 runs off Franklyn Rose 's third over .
Reon King bowled superbly to keep New Zealand 's early batting in check and score after 15 overs when fielding restrictions ended was 71 for three , compared with the West Indies ' 96 without loss at the same stage .
