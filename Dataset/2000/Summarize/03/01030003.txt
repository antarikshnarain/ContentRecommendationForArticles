Taliban disowns statement 

In a sudden shift of tack , the Taliban today denied that any of its functionaries had stated that the five hijackers and three militants had left Kandahar for Quetta in north-west Pakistan .
A report in the Jang newspaper on Saturday quoted the Taliban Information Minister , Mr. Abdul Hai Mutmaen , as saying that the hijackers had left Kandahar for Quetta after Iftar .
The Taliban also made the rather bizarre claim that under the agreement reached between the militia , the Government of India and the hijackers , the three parties were bound not to reveal the ` ` destination' ' of the desperadoes .
This belated denial by the Taliban appears to be an obvious consequence of the negative publicity for Pakistan after reports that the hijackers had left for Quetta on Friday evening .
` ` Pakistan is on a high alert , and in case they enter Pakistani territory , they will be apprehended and tried as per established international rules and conventions to which Pakistan is a signatory,' ' he was quoted as telling the official APP news agency .
` ` In case they sneak into NWFP ( North-West Frontier Province ) or Balochistan , they will be detained and tried according to law and rules .
