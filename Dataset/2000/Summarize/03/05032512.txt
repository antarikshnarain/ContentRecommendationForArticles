Now for a thorough inquiry

WITH THE RELEASE of the hostages and the hijackers driving away to freedom , it is now time for the Government of India and various agencies to piece together all sordid details of the hijack drama .
Starting from what happened at the Kathmandu airport and how the hijackers managed to smuggle weapons and explosives into the IA aircraft , to the delay in responding to the crisis at Amritsar and letting go of the opportunity to deal with the hijackers when the plane stopped in Abu Dhabi , there is a lot that the Government must explain .
After the aircraft was allowed to fly out of Indian skies , there was a second chance to deal with the hijackers at the Al Minhad airbase in the UAE or in Abu Dhabi .
Above all , there needs to be a comprehensive review of the security arrangements in airports , jails and Indian missions which may be targets and the whole security procedure for boarding aircraft .
If certain facilities can not be provided in some foreign airports like Kathmandu , Indian Airlines or Air India must introduce a special security check before passengers board the aircraft .
There is need for global conventions to deal with hijackers , at least to make sure they do not go scot-free after killing innocent hostages and securing the release of known terrorists .
