Mr. Yeltsin's surprise decision 

EVEN JUDGING BY his own rather unconventional ways and unorthodox methods , Mr. Boris Yeltsin 's surprise action in announcing his resignation as Russia 's President should be difficult to read .
Mr. Yeltsin 's supporters and sympathisers had scored a spectacular and unexpected victory in parliamentary elections in mid-December , presenting him with the prospect of a harmonious relationship between the legislature and the executive .
From the Chinese capital , he rattled his nuclear arsenal , only to be reminded politely by his American counterpart that he owed his position in Moscow not a little to the support given by the Western nations at a critical time of transition for his country .
The Presidential election , due in six months , has now been advanced by three months and Mr. Yeltsin has anointed Mr. Putin , a Soviet secret service top brass , as his nominee .
Mr. Yeltsin , himself a top Soviet communist party official , came into prominence when , in a classic act of defiance , he led the resistance against coup plotters who tried to overthrow the last Soviet President , Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev .
His rise to the Presidency , showdown with the Duma when he ordered tanks to open fire on the Parliament building to flush out Opposition members holed up inside , the manner in which he sacked his whole Cabinet overnight without offering any explanation ( his opponents call it a brain bypass ) , other bizarre actions , some of them certainly impulsive and inexplicable , and the strong , even desperate measures he has undertaken to defeat armed militancy in Chechnya will ensure that he leaves a mixed legacy .
