U.S. newspaper apologises to Sikh community 

` ` At the times,' ' said the newspaper 's Foreign Editor , Mr. David W Jones , ` ` we can easily argue that we were not strictly speaking wrong - that we accurately reported what the UAE brigadier ( Brig Atiq Juma ) said and that even if there was a Mistake , it was AP 's , not ours .
` ` And so the Sikhs ( who protested their misidentification in a letter to the paper ) have struck a responsive chord with their complaint in their letter that we failed to find the facts patiently and professionally,' ' he said .
