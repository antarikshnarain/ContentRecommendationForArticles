How can one buy gold from a dealer at the prevailing prices , spend money on making ornaments , spend money on showroom overheads , and then offer the finished products at the price of the raw material bought .

LET US share some appropriate thoughts for the New Year : Here 's a health to the future , A sigh for the past ; We can love and remember , And hope to the last ; And for all the base lies That the almanacs hold , While there is love in the heart , We can never grow old .
And let us say fervently to our readers ; Happy are we met , Happy have we been / Happy may we part , and Happy we meet again .
