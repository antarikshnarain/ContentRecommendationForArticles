Sitting ducks for McGrath, Lee 

Brett Lee on a hat-trick was familiar ; Ajit Agarkar , who could ` ` bat a bit' ' but was out to first ball for the fourth successive time was familiar ; the highly-rated middle-order collapsing in a heap was familiar ; Sachin Tendulkar done in by the umpire was familiar .
Nothing was more depressing than watching Tendulkar alone in the middle trying to ward off the threat from the aggressive Aussies with McGrath , Fleming and Lee bowling a splendid line all along .
Mark Waugh appeared in his 100th Test match while McGrath and Lee , both locals , gave them enough to cheer with their inspired assault on the opposition .
