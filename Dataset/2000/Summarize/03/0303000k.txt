U.S. pins hopes on W. Asia talks 

With Israel and Syria getting together for their tough negotiating sessions starting on Wednesday , there is no doubt that senior officials of the Clinton administration will be with the teams all the way .
The President , Mr. Bill Clinton , is expected to be at the start of the first session at Sheperdstown , West Virginia ; and both the Secretary of State , Ms. Madeleine Albright , and the top West Asia negotiator , Mr. Dennis Ross , will be available throughout , it is being maintained .
As in the case of any sensitive and high profile involvement of the United States - Camp David or the Wye Plantations , for instance - the venue for the Israel-Syria talks has been deliberately chosen .
The administration and the White House have made it clear that a peace accord between these two critical West Asia States is a very high foreign policy priority for this year ; and there is no doubt that Mr. Clinton would like to see a comprehensive West Asia peace as a part of the history books and his eight-year legacy by the time he steps down formally in January 2001 .
Syria is demanding that all of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967 must be returned in return for ` ` peace,' ' the terms of which is yet to be clearly spelt out .
Some argue that the price tag for peace between Israel and Syria would be anywhere between $ 10 and $ 20 billions ; and the money for this has to be appropriated by Congress .
