Release of hostages is not the end of matter: U.S.

The Clinton administration has not said much officially on the whereabouts of the hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight 814 ; but is expected to be following the situation very carefully .
Islamabad 's contention that it is on high alert for the hijackers and the three freed terrorists , and will put them on trial if arrested will be put to test in the next several days .
The Taliban Representative at the United Nations , Mr. Abdul Hakeem Mujahid , had said in a conversation with The Hindu that the hijackers and the three freed terrorists would ` ` never' ' be allowed to stay behind in Afghanistan .
The fate of the hijackers and their freed ` ` friends' ' was apparently one of the most difficult issues that had to be sorted out in the final phases .
If the Taliban Representative was repeatedly firm and adamant that the hijackers and the freed terrorists had ` ` to get out' ' of Afghanistan , some of this had to do with media reports circulating that somehow the hijackers and the freed terrorists would be staying back in Afghanistan to face the local law .
Although the administration has an official channel open with the Taliban , there is actually no love lost for this outfit , especially when it relates to Osama bin Laden and the persistent demand that he should be handed over to the U.S. authorities .
