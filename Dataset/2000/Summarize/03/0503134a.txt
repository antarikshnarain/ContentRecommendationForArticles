Provocation, intimidation beyond the Dangs 

For the leadership of the Christian community the police inspector 's pro-activism could not possibly be seen in isolation from what was happening - or was allowed to happen - in the Dangs , which last year saw a lot of anti-Christian violence , and where this year Christmas could be celebrated ` ` peacefully' ' only because of the presence of a very large police force and a strong media contingent .
A somewhat perplexed Home Minister summoned the inspector to demand an explanation , and got an equally puzzling reply that the local police station was just getting itself armed with the requisite information to respond to the Government 's anticipated query as to how many people had joined in the Christmas celebration .
Whether the police inquisitiveness at the Loyola Complex was a micro-aberration or part of a larger mindset , the incident simply underlines the extraordinary disquiet that has come to grip the Christian community since the BJP came to power in Gandhinagar in March 1998 .
On the other hand , Mr. Haren Pandya argues that ` ` last year there was violence in the Dangs , hence so much attention was paid this year ; there was no violence this time , and I am sure there will be no trouble and no media attention next year .
Provocation forethought Notwithstanding Mr. Pandya 's tone of self-congratulation over the peaceful denouement of the ` Dharma Sabha ' on Christmas Day in Ahwa , there is no getting away from the fact that the Government showed itself to be less than fully mindful of its constitutional duty .
The decision of one Vidyashanker Bharatiya Maharaj , a newly- minted Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Karwarpeeth ( nobody in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar was able to attest to the veracity of the ` peeth ' of this Shankaracharya ) to hold a Dharma Sabha in Ahwa , the site of anti-Christian violence last year , was provocation forethought .
