'Release illegal' 

The release of two top militant leaders from the Kotbhalwal sub-jail in Jammu and the Central Jail Srinagar , has generated much debate with legal experts saying that no norms were followed and that the exercise was ` ` illegal' ' , carried out ` ` under pressure' ' and done in a hush-hush manner .
The Chief Minister , Dr. Farooq Abdullah , in an interview , also denied having any role in freeing seven militants in exchange for Dr . Rubiya Sayeed , the daughter of the former Union Home Minister , Mufti Mohammad Sayeed .
Even otherwise , the State police had failed to prove any case against the Harkat-ul-Ansar general secretary , Moulana Masood Azhar , as also the chief commander of Al-Umar-Mujahideen , Mushtaq Zargar .
In the case of Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar , a senior lawyer of the J&K ; High Court said his being taken to Kandahar was ` ` illegal' ' as the court , was not informed and no permission was sought .
