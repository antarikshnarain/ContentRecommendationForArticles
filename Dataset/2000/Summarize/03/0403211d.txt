Backward class politics at a turning point 

In fact , the Sivagiri police action came in handy for the Left coalition , particularly the CPI ( M ) , to play up the emotions of the Ezhava community during the 1996 Assembly elections .
A striking feature at that time was the CPI ( M ) 's open support to the dominant Swami Saswathikananda faction , which was ousted out of power from the Sivagiri Madhom following the police action , which was itself a consequence of a High Court verdict directing the then Antony Government to take steps to hand over the trust administration to the rival faction led by Swami Prakashananda .
The Antony Government was instrumental in passing a law protecting backward class reservation from the creamy layer norm , followed by the arrack ban , intended to break the clout of the liquor lobby which had links to a predominant section in the Ezhava community .
Besides , a predominant section in the Congress ( I ) , including the senior leader , Mr. K. Karunakaran , and the former KPCC ( I ) president , Mr . Vayalar Ravi , did not see eye to eye with the Antony Government 's actions .
Given the fact that Mr. Karunakaran was the only Congress ( I ) leader to appear on the Sivagiri platform since the police action , the invitations extended to several Congress ( I ) leaders , including Mr. Aryadan Mohammed , and Mr. G. Karthikeyan , both MLAs , to participate in the Sivagiri pilgrimage functions are being viewed as a silver lining .
As the situation has vastly changed since the 1995 police action , the question before the two main political fronts is whether they could neutralise the designs of the BJP , which hopes to secure a toehold in Kerala , by playing ( if necessary blatantly ) , the backward class card .
