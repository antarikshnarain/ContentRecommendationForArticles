Commercial strokes? 

In the millennium we have just left behind , it seems that the main social function of art was the absorption of excess cash .
Public and private demand for not just impressionist , modern and contemporary works , but also prints and photography , Oriental art and primitive art has been rising thunderously ever since World War II .
From pre-Columbian artefacts to contemporary photographs , as we update the records , look over the overlooked as well as the overvalued , and attempt at an analysis of our own , one thing is certain - unimpeded by the slump in the stock market and depression in real estate and other similar segments of business , the art market is not showing any signs of fatigue .
As the veteran art collector Jehangir Nicholson , whose private collection forms the Jehangir Nicholson Gallery of Modern Art , said : " Of course all these auctions by Sotheby 's , Christies ' , Asprey 's and others are important for the causes they represent , but in the end you do n't want to buy art just for the cause .
When you are buying for status , you do not buy what you like , you buy what other people like or , more accurately , what people like you will freely admit to liking .
Art must indeed remain accessible to all , but the creative individual needs to operate within a framework that reflects integrity and commitment to our idiom that does not compromise on aesthetic values .
