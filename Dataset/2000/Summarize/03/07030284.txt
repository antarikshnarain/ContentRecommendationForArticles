England loses ground after solid start 

Allan Donald , often bowling at top pace , took the wickets of Mike Atherton , Mark Butcher , Alec Stewart and Andrew Caddick as he claimed four for 42 in 20 overs and took his series total to 20 .
The sun shone brightly , a strong breeze ran round Table Mountain and its environs and the series between South Africa and England was tantalisingly poised ; it was a good day for a cricket fan to be alive as we drove through the avenues of trees that lead from the dockside in this , the loveliest of South African cities to the suburb that holds one of the most beautiful grounds .
An hour after lunch , Atherton flirted with a ball from Allan Donald outside off stump and next ball sent a flailing hook high to Gary Kirsten running and diving to take the catch at long leg .
Hussain and Butcher dropped anchor but , after ten runs in ten overs , Butcher , who had been 41 balls on 37 , drove another wide ball loftily to third man where Kirsten took his second catch .
The capacity crowd above 20,000 could not have had a more evenly contested match but when Hussain was caught at the wicket after trying in vain to get his gloves out of the way of a nasty curling ball from Paul Adams , the game had swung completely towards South Africa .
Hansie Cronje , leading South Africa for the 50th time , grabbed the new ball straight away but Stewart , hooking and then hitting through Donald 's quick ball , brought up the fifty stand and then missed with two wild shots .
