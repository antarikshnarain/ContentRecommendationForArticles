We have evidence against Pak., says Brajesh Mishra

The National Security Adviser , Mr. Brajesh Mishra , today said there was ` ` enough and clear' ' evidence to suggest that Pakistan was involved in the hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane and ruled out the possibility of Taliban having provided arms to the hijackers in Kandahar .
The behaviour of Pakistan from the first day when it said that India had stage-managed the hijacking and that an Indian intelligence agent with a particular seat number was travelling in the aircraft showed Pakistan 's intentions , he said while participating in a programme on Star News .
` ` We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani nationals , and most of the militants they wanted to be released are Pakistani nationals,' ' he said .
