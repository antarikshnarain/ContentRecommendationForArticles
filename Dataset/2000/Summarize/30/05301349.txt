Golan is their goal 

WHEN TALKS between Syria and Israel resumed in mid-February , Mr . Farooq al Sharaa , Syria 's Foreign Minister , made an impassioned speech in which he said that the West had not paid adequate attention to the suffering of the Arab peoples at Israel 's hands .
Upwards of another 1,50,000 Golan residents , mainly Druze , continue to live on the Golan under Israeli occupation but have refused to relinquish their loyalties to Syria .
These projections might not be accurate ( for instance , the fact that the population growth rate among religious Jews is far higher than that of the secular does not appear to have been adequately assessed ) but the Arabs do recognise that the future need not be wholly captive to the past .
Other than a deal which enables Egypt to sell its gas to Israel , and the sight of Israeli tourists at the Pyramids or the Taba sea resort , there is very little to show that the peoples of the two countries have kissed and made up .
Given the increasing edge which Israeli is acquiring in the technological dimension of warfare , unstinting U.S. support to it and the burgeoning relationship between Tel Aviv and Ankara , the Syrian prospects in a military confrontation with Israel are fast dwindling .
Even after he restores the Golan to Syrian sovereignty , Mr. Assad might face the hostility of militant Sunni groups who are ideologically committed to the destruction of Israel .
