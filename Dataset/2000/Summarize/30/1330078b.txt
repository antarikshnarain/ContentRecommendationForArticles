A witness to his times

" Satyan remembers his classmates and contemporaries - Sharada Prasad , R . K. Laxman , Veena Doraiswamy Iyengar and economist P. R . Brahmananda among others .
After graduating from Mysore University in 1944 , Satyan worked as a teacher for some time , a radio news reader in the local Akashvani , and as organising secretary with the Adult Education Council .
Satyan also worked for many journals apart from LIFE and carried out prestigious assignments for the United Nations and its allied agencies , notably UNICEF .
Introducing Satyan 's Retrospective , now touring India ( it has already been viewed by people in Mysore , Bangalore , Udupi , Mumbai and New Delhi ) , H. Y. Sharada Prasad , eminent journalist and former Information Adviser to the Prime Minister , says : " I have marvelled at the speed at which his eye and mind size up the pictorial possibilities of a situation .
" Talking about his oeuvre , Satyan says : " My subjects are ordinary people with whom I am completely at ease .
" Satyan is very fond of quoting Paul Strand : " Your photography is a record of your living , for anyone who really sees .
