Amendment versus re-evaluation 

Since any constitutional change is made via amendments , positions like that staked out by the Congress - ` ` we are not against amendments but strongly opposed to reviews' ' - make no legal sense at all .
The omnibus Amendment which altered various Articles of the Constitution was , among other things , cynically directed at strengthening the legislature and the cost of the judiciary by circumscribing the scope of judicial review and rendering the privileges of the legislature immune from judicial audit .
The Congress has found it expedient to hail the President , Mr. K . R. Narayanan 's ` ` wise words' ' opposing a constitutional review and asserted that the Constitution has stood the test of scrutiny and time .
One amendment ( 39th ) , which was subsequently struck down by the Supreme Court on the ground that it militates against the principle of free and fair election , seemed as if it was directed for the sole purpose of protecting the Prime Minister from being challenged in connection with her election to Parliament .
The amendment was specifically directed at overturning the Supreme Court 's judgment in the Golak Nath v. State of Punjab case , in which the Bench ruled that no constitutional amendment can abridge or take away a fundamental right .
Until we know something about its recommendations - which in any case have to undergo the same constitutional procedure for making amendments if accepted - it is both premature and futile to make the issue a bone of political contention .
