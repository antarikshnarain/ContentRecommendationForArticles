Rebels hold ground in Grozny 

After five weeks of fierce fighting and hundreds of soldiers killed , Russian forces are yet to break rebel resistance in the Chechen capital Grozny .
The capture of Grozny , the last rebel stronghold in the lowland part of Chechnya , would enable Moscow to claim that the main military phase of the war was over and only scattered groups of militants would remain to be hunted down in the mountains .
Official casualty figures released this week suggest that Russians have lost 525 soldiers killed in Chechnya during four weeks of the storming of the Chechen capital .
The official count for the 21- month first Chechen war was 3,963 soldiers and officers killed , working out to 188 deaths a month , against 204 a month in the current campaign .
Reuters reports : A group of 54 Chechen rebels have surrendered in the Chechen capital Grozny , the chief Russian spokesman on the conflict , was quoted as saying today .
Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying that the group surrendered to local prosecutors and to the militia commanded by the pro-Moscow Chechen leader , Mr. Bislan Gantamirov .
