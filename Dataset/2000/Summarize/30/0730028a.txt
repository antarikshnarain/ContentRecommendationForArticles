Olonga rips through England innings 

Henry Olonga , the Zimbabwe fast bowler , bowling at top pace , snatched five wickets in succession to set up victory against England in the triangular tournament match at Newlands tonight .
Olonga , who had previously taken 28 wickets at 31 runs each in his 21 one-day International appearances , had figures of 8-3-18-5 when he went off soon after England was 47 for six .
He began with the wicket of opener Nick Knight , palpably lbw plunging forward in his usual heavy-footed way , had Graeme Hick caught behind two balls later , Vikram Solanki taken overhead at point after two flashing fours , bowled the captain Nasser Hussain and had Chris Adams snatched up at slip .
It was a superb exhibition of fast bowling which left England , which needed only 212 , gasping as it tried to avoid its lowest ever score , 93 against Australia in the World Cup back in 1975 .
Its score of 211 , a winning total on this strange one- day pitch at Newlands , was built around a laboured 97 from Neil Johnson , its opening batsman who would not be deterred from his purpose of batting all the way through the innings .
Earlier Hick had caught a ball from Grant Flower that went so high - as Hick circled underneath from square leg to long leg - that the batsmen crossed twice .
