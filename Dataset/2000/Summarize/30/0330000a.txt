Conservatives step up onslaught 

One of them , Mr. Mohammed Reza Khatami , is the brother of the reformist President , Mr. Hojatolesslam Syed Mohammed Khatami , and the other Mr. Ali Reza Nouri , the brother of the jailed dissident cleric , Mr. Abdollah Nouri .
If the reformers achieve a big victory , this might be a minor problem since they could ask one of their winning candidates to step down in favour of Mr. Abdollah Nouri who was the automatic first choice till he was sentenced to imprisonment by a clerical court .
Even if the reformers win they might not be able to immediately revoke Mr. Nouris ' conviction but a big reform victory could unleash a sea-change in Iranian politics and some of the edicts of the conservative-dominated establishment will not survive .
But it is probable that Mr. Khatami will not be able to campaign very effectively for his loyalists since the conservatives are bound to protest against what they would describe as partisanship by the President .
Well before the election process got underway , it was clear the conservative-dominated Council of Guardians , which vets candidates and monitors the poll , would disqualify as many prominent reformers as they possibly could .
Unless the pro-reform groups can reconcile their panels and get some to withdraw they might confuse the voters and scatter the pro-reform vote .
