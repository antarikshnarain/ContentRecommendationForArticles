Review for better governance: Joshi 

The Centre 's proposal to set up a commission to review the Constitution was part of an effort to create a system least affected by human failures , according to the Union Minister for Human Resource Development , Dr. Murali Manohar Joshi .
Speaking to presspersons here today , Dr. Joshi said that after 50 years of the formation of the Republic of India , it is appropriate to have a look at the strengths and weaknesses of the ` basic document ' which has been amended 79 times .
` ` It is a living and dynamic document and the nation has to think and ponder whether the objectives laid down in the Preamble of the Constitution have been pursued and how far they have been fulfilled and also whether there is a systemic failure in providing justice , social and economic , to the poorest of the poor .
' ' In an apparent comment on the Presidential remarks , Dr . Joshi said ` ` even if it is a human failure , as argued by some , we have to create a system least affected by human failures .
' ' Observing that ` ` a periodic check-up of our system is an exercise to keep the immunity intact,' ' Dr. Joshi said that the country was facing challenges both from within and outside .
Dr. Joshi , who repeatedly asserted that the basic features of the Constitution can not be changed , however , maintained that a change-over from the present Prime Ministerial system to a Presidential system did not amount to a change in the basic features .
