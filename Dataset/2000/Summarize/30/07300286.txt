Exhibiting character in trying situations

Even as dawn flushed the Colombo sky pink the day after India 's magnificent triumph in the second ICC under-19 World Cup , one sat back to relive and recount the moments and those wonderful boys who made it all possible - exhibiting character in trying situations .
Reetinder Singh Sodhi , the vice-captain , displayed the cutting edge in him with that all-round showing in the final against Sri Lanka which won him the man of the match award .
In the summer of '96 in England , Sodhi led from the front , scoring an unbeaten 82 and taking three wickets with his mediumpace against Pakistan in the final of the Lombard under-15 World Cup .
Kaif and I know how it felt missing a berth in the final in the last World Cup where we beat Pakistan in the final super-league game but failed to upstage England 's Net Run Rate to qualify .
He bowled his quota of 10 overs on the trot for just 26 runs , took a sensational catch to dismiss Ranil Dhammika , effected the run out of Ganegama and then made an unbeaten 39 to guide the side to victory along with the dapper left-hander Niraj Patel .
Niraj Patel , one with a bright future , played the support role superbly right through while Yuveraj , adjudged the man of the tournament , is capable of winning matches singlehandedly when on roll .
