Fighting pollution

Despite claims made by the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) that pollution in Delhi has reduced because of various preventive measures , it is difficult to accept these claims .
But he does say that if pollution control has to be tackled it has to be this way : " improve public transport and discourage private transport " .
The second theory is that if there is moisture in the air , it mixes with dust particles making it more difficult for moisture to be released into the upper strata of the atmosphere .
This includes the phatphaties ( World War Two vintage heavy motor bikes on which a carriage is mounted ) and all 15-year-old vehicles ; the quality of petrol has improved with lead being removed and the introduction of pre-mixed 2T oil for two-stroke scooter engines .
Even in the big cities where treated , piped water is supplied , the excessive use of bore wells , booster pumps and sewage lines running close to rusted and broken water pipes is causing water contamination .
Both diesel and petrol vehicles have to observe Euro standards set for April 2000 , where a multi-point fuel injection system is mandatory .
