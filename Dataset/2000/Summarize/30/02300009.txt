Badal tries to play peacemaker in 'hukumnama' crisis

Even as a massive damage control exercise is underway to deal with the fallout of the crisis emerging out of the ` hukumnama ' issued by the Jathedar of the Akal Takht , Giani Puran Singh , the Punjab Chief Minister and president of the Shiromani Akali Dal ( SAD ) , Mr. Parkash Singh Badal , has taken some personal initiatives .
This section has been quite active and worked in tandem since the Jathedar issued the edict to excommunicate the president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( SGPC ) , Bibi Jagir Kaur .
Meanwhile , various sections of Punjab 's religio- political circles are awaiting the arrival of Giani Puran Singh , who is returning after attending the installation ceremony of Bhai Kulwant Singh as the Jathedar of Takht Hazur Sahib at Nanded in Maharashtra .
It is expected that Bhai Kulwant Singh and a representative of the Jathedar of Takht Patna Sahib , who are accompanying Giani Puran Singh to Amritsar , would participate in the February 2 meeting at the Akal Takht .
While Bibi Jagir Kaur has maintained that she had not received any copy of the summons and has been resisting efforts to persuade her to submit , the senior SGPC vice-president , Mr . Balbir Singh Pannu , while accepting the validity of the ` ` hukumnama' ' , said that no decision on appearing before the Akal Takht had been taken .
These Akali factions have also appealed to Giani Puran Singh to summon Mr. Badal for violating a previous ` ` hukumnama' ' issued by Akal Takht on December 12 , 1998 , by the then Jathedar , Bhai Ranjit Singh , directing a cease-fire between Akali factions till the completion of the tercentenary celebrations of the creation of Khalsa .
