Water... fire and brimstone 

Although Mr . Advani and RSS leaders have often talked about the ` ` Indian culture that is essentially Hindu' ' because of the predomination of Hindus in the population of this country , in practise the RSS and the BJP have been intolerant of the non-Hindu streams that make up Indian culture and have very little understanding of what culture , Indian or any other , is all about .
After some desperate efforts , Ms. Mehta managed to get an assurance from the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary , Mr. Yogendra Narain , who has now reportedly directed the Varanasi district authorities to provide Ms. Mehta 's team full security and allow her to proceed with the shooting of the film .
His allegation was that Ms. Mehta was up to no good , and that her film would dwell on the dirt and squalor of Kashi , on the pitiable condition of the widows who eke out their lives around the ghats , and that ` ` this hurts our religious sentiments for Varanasi is the holiest city for Hindus'' .
A top functionary in Sanskar Bharati based in Agra identified as ` ` Bankeyji' ' said reports had come that Ms. Mehta 's script dwells on the condition of ` ` the widows from Bengal' ' and that ` ` we would not have protested if she had chosen to show a rounded picture of what Varanasi is and what it means to Hindus'' .
` ` We plan to set up another front called the ` Kashi Sanskriti Raksha Manch',' ' Mr . Jitendra , an office-bearer of the Sanskar Bharati 's Varanasi unit , told TheHindu.He said that ` ` it is the people who are opposed to her film .
It was the anger of 80 per cent Hindus in this country which demolished the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya , it was the ` ` people' ' who expressed their resentment against Husain for daring to offend their religious sentiments , it was the ` ` people' ' who were horrified by Ms. Mehta 's ` ` Fire' ' , and now again it is the ` ` people' ' who apprehend she will offend their sensibilities with her new venture , ` ` Water'' .
