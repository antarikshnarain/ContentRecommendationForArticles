Hindutva: Time to get rid of the mask

It is time for them to come right out and say , for example , that not only the Babri Masjid , but , they believe , also the mosques at Mathura and Varanasi must be razed to the ground ; only thus can the past be amicably buried .
It is time for them to speak out about how precisely they propose to use " courage " to resolve the Kashmir issue ; for them to speak out in a forthright fashion about what they believe needs to be done about cow slaughter and how ; and about Article 370 , the uniform civil code , doing away with the distorted history taught in schools ; time to seek inputs from learned sadhus and sants , into the political process , to purify and energise our politics , following the example of Bangladesh , Pakistan and Iran .
This realisation forced itself on me quite suddenly , one fine day ; when I was trying to understand the sad fate of many bright , painstaking and highly committed children who have remained too long with no one but themselves for company ; other than people who think just like them .
That these fantastic views are able to remain undetected , unchallenged , in areas where children do not have to act on their faulty suppositions , is largely on account of the way language is imbued with private , personalised meanings , and therefore cuts children ( or grown-ups ) off from the real world instead of connecting them to it .
The mere difference , then , of telling one 's thoughts to others , or of keeping silence and telling it only to oneself , or only to people who are almost like one 's own self , makes a simply enormous difference to the fundamental structure and functioning of thought ; to the level of its sophistication .
A child habituated to visionary or " romantic " thinking faces great difficulty in trying to get his ideas across to other people ; to people who are not exactly like him .
