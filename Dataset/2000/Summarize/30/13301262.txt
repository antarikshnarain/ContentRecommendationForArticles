Escape to freedom?

The same uneasy oscillation between the tragic and the picturesque has informed the media response to the recent escape of Ugyen Trinley Dorje , 17th head of the Karmapa branch of the Kagyu order ( the oldest of Tibetan Buddhisms four principal monastic orders ) .
Much wit has been expended , for example , on explaining the semiotics of the " red " , " black " , " white " and " yellow ceremonial hats " by which members of the Tibetan monastic orders are differentiated .
In chronological order of emergence , the major orders are the Kagyupa , the Nyingmapa , the Sakyapa and the Gelugpa ( the Dalai Lama belongs to the last and youngest of these , the Gelugpa or " Yellow Hats " , who have held undisputed sway over Tibet since the mid-17th Century ) .
The much-publicised Karmapa represents an off-shoot of the Kagyu and is credited with having devised the tulku system of incarnate succession , in which the incarnations of lamas are recognised as children and trained to continue along the path of enlightenment ; this principle of the continuity of consciousness from one life to the next was later taken up by the rival Gelugpa and is enshrined in their premier institution , that of the Dalai Lama .
The persistence of folk religion can also generate problems like the one revealed during an acrimonious 1996 controversy , after the Dalai Lama tried to ban the cultic worship of a figure called Dorje Shugden and was accused , by Shugden worshippers , of infringing upon their freedom of worship .
Cautious diplomats on both sides of the Himalayan range have suggested that the Karmapa lama is visiting India to look for musical instruments required for his ceremonial practice ; but the teenage hierarch may himself be destined to serve as an instrument in a drama whose implications he and his fellow monks may not have fully grasped .
