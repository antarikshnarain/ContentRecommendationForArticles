Union Minister criticises TMC 

The Union Power Minister , Mr Rangarajan Kumaramangalam , today criticised the TMC 's decision to support the AIADMK in the byelections despite Mr Moopanar 's earlier pronouncements on keeping both the communal and corrupt forces at equi-distance .
A ` ` false propaganda' ' was being carried out to portray the BJP as a communal party though there has been no incident of communal violence in the country during the 100 days of Vajpayee government , he said and called upon the NDA partners to defeat the ` ` smear campaign .

Vaiko assails TMC : Our Tirunelveli Staff Reporter writes : The MDMK general secretary , Mr. Vaiko , MP , denounced the TMC for extending support to the AIADMK .
In a chat with press persons in Tirunelveli today , Mr. Vaiko said Mr. Moopanar 's explanation that his party was supporting the AIADMK ` in the larger interest of consolidation of secular votes ' was only to divert the attention of the people from the main issues .
Referring to the statement of Mr. Moopanar that this arrangement was only for the by-elections , Mr. Vaiko said this only reflected how confused he was and also showed how he could not digest his own decision of extending support ` voluntarily ' to the AIADMK .
