Russia minting rupees for India 

A Russian mint has been working full steam to fulfill India 's order for making 400 million five-rupee coins and hopes to win more contracts from the Indian treasury .
` ` Organisers of the tender set very tough terms - almost no prepayment , low production costs , high quality , and short production time,' ' said the mint 's manager , Mr. Yuri Yermakov .
The face value of the coins will be close to $ 46.5 million , and the Indian Government will pay the mint the equivalent of around $ 16 millions , in Deutsche marks , the currency chosen for the transaction .
According to Mr. Yermakov , the Indian side was happy with the quality of the coins minted so far and placed another order with his mint to make dies for two-rupee coins .
To fill the India order , the mint got a trade loan from Russia 's Norilsk Nickel , the world largest producer of non- ferrous metals .
With the Russian market for coins saturated , the mint has recently fallen on hard times , laying off 250 workers , about a third of its staff , and scaling down production by two-thirds .
