BJP defends move to review Constitution

` ` The fruits of development have not reached a majority of our countrymen' ' even after 53 years of Independence , Mr. Naidu said , But party leaders were not able to point to any specific provision in the Constitution that has prevented this from happening .
A senior party leader , who was at one time involved in studying the Constitution and preparing a review report , pointed to the directive principles , which have remained enshrined in the Constitution but have not been implemented .
The intention to bring in a uniform civil code , a part of the directive principles , was mentioned by him as an example even as it was quickly added that the review proposed by the Government was not intended to touch the ` ` contentious issues' ' raised earlier by the BJP but which were not part of the National Agenda for Governance adopted by the Vajpayee-led Government .
Mr. Naidu also used the occasion to point out that the need for a uniform civil code was not ` ` our hidden agenda' ' but a part of the directive principles of the Constitution .
Mr. Naidu said that if ` ` we' ' have failed the Constitution , it could only mean that the Congress ( I ) , which ruled the country for the longest time , has failed and has been unable to translate the ` ` noble ideals' ' in the preamble to the Constitution into a reality for the common man .
