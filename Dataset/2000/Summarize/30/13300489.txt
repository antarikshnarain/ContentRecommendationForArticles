Wasting away of the muscles

MUSCULAR Dystrophy is of various types of which the most common and severe is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy .
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by the lack of a single protein called dystrophin in muscle fibre .
Females have a pair of x chromosomes whereas males have only one x and one y .
Since the defective gene is carried only in x , a woman with DMD gene in one of her two x chromosomes will not develop Duchenne muscular dystrophy .
Research : Since DMD is the result of the lack of the protein dystrophin in the muscle fibre , gene therapy or restitution of dystrophin by means of this technique has been tried but has met with a number of hurdles .
Utrophin , a naturally occurring protein can be a promising substitute for dystrophin because its DNA and protein sequences are similar to those of dystrophin and it can replace the function of the missing dystrophin protein in DMD patients .
