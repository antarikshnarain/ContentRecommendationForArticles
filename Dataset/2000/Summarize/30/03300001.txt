An 'India evening' at Davos 

Putting behind heady debates on globalisation and business deals , several top business executives and political leaders took time off to get a glimpse and taste of Indian dance and cuisine at the ongoing annual meeting of the World Economic Forum on Friday .
The reception area for the ` ` India evening' ' at the conference centre was full even as a ` ` Garbha' ' dance and fashion show featuring top Indian models held the delegates spellbound for an hour .
Indian participation at the meeting of the world 's business and political elite was also significant this year since it was the first time that two regional leaders - the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister , Mr. N. Chandrababu Naidu , and his Karnataka counterpart , Mr. S. M. Krishna , - were invited .
The menu for the reception prepared by the Taj group ranged from ` ` seekh kababs' ' and ` ` chicken tikkas' ' to ` ` samosas' ' and ` ` rice pulao'' .
