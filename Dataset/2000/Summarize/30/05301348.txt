The peace is broken 

And the leaders of the two radical nationalist parties , Herri Batasuna ( HB or the political wing of the ETA ) and Euskal Herritarok ( EH ) , maintained a sullen silence when asked to condemn the killing .
Mr. Aznar 's party has accused one of its supporters , the moderate Basque PNV party which heads the regional government in the Basque country , of tolerating pro- ETA radicals .
In the Basque province of Navarre , the Interior Minister , Mr . Jaime Mayor Oreja , turned on Mr. Xabier Arzalluz , who leads the PNV , growling : ` ` How many more deaths will it take for you to snap ties with the radical separatists ( EH , HB ) ?
' ' The ETA made its ceasefire announcement on September 16 , 1998 , partly because it was exhausted and needed to buy time to re- group and partly because it felt it could wrest political concessions from Mr. Aznar 's Government for a ` ` nationalist Basque project'' .
After the Zurich meeting between the Government and the ETA failed last May , Mr. Josep Piqui , Government spokesman , said : ` ` The only answer the Spanish State will give ETA is to stop the bombings and arrest the perpetrators .
In the meanwhile , residents of Bilbao , San Sebastian and other major Basque towns are expressing anger at the Government 's failure to seize the opportunity offered by the 14-month ceasefire , the longest in the history of the 35-year-old Basque separatist struggle .
