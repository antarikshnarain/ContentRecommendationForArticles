Gandhi through German eyes

As a young man in Nazi Germany , Herbert Fischer read about Gandhi in a magazine called Tao , published in Switzerland by Werner Zimmermann .
They had a long and emotional conversation , and before they left , the Mahatma had typed and signed this personal testimonial : " I have known Mr. Herbert Fischer and his wife for a long time .
Previously I had only Fischer 's spoken words to go by , but I have now obtained a copy of an extended essay written by him and published by the Gandhi Informations Zentrum in Berlin .
It gives , as no other work I have seen , a vivid feel for the annual Congress session as held in that party 's pomp : the " huts erected from light bamboo mats on bare fields , " the " discussions [ which ] took place in the open on a raised platform " such that " everyone could hear what the leaders said , " and , above all , the magnificent presence of the Mahatma : " After the sessions , during the meals and at other functions , there was always a great rush .
" It had a few solid buildings and a number of huts whose walls were made of bamboo mats coated with clay and cowdung.... after some time , I got a hut about two-and-half metres by two-and-a-half metres in dimension .
As he says with regard to the Mahatma 's decision to kill a poisonous snake in the ashram , " he did not bind himself in literal interpretations [ in this case , of ahimsa ] , but decided each situation on humanitarian grounds .
