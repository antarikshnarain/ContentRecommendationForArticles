Davenport ends Hingis' three-year domination

Down 1-5 , 1-5 and 15-30 on her big-serving opponent 's serve , Hingis , champion three times in a row and unbeaten in the Australian Open since 1996 , staged a remarkable comeback that fell short of the miraculous as Davenport stamped out the teenager 's attempt to resurrect herself just in time for a 6-1 , 7-5 victory in the women 's singles final .
In the next game , serving to stay in the match yet again , Hingis sent down a double fault and then made a backhand error - she made far too many mistakes on that flank this afternoon - to find herself tottering on the very brink .
