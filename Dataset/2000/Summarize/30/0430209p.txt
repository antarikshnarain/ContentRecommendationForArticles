J & K Govt., employees on collision course

With the failure of the latest effort to hammer out a solution to end the 40-day-old strike by State Government employees , the Government and the Employees ' Joint Action Committee ( EJAC ) are headed for a showdown , with the Government having initiated the process of fresh recruitments .
The EJAC has been demanding the release of cash payments of DA installments due from January 1999 , the second installment of the Fifth Pay Commission implementation and an increase in the age limit for retirement .
The decision to recruit stenographers and orderlies is seen as an effort to teach the employees - who are ` ` not ready to realise the problems of the State' ' - a lesson.Meanwhile , the EJAC has reiterated that it would not be deterred by the threat of harsh measures and the strike would continue till their demands are conceded .
Hundreds of employees held a demonstration here near the Ahata Amar Singh Government quarters and demanded the release of 278 employees who have been arrested under the Essential Services Maintenance Act ( ESMA ) .
