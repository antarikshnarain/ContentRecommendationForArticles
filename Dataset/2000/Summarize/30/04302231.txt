TMC whip quits Assembly seat 

Even as some senior TMC leaders today denied any dissension in the party over its decision to support the AIADMK in the coming by-elections , Mr. R. Chokkar , party whip in the Assembly , has resigned his membership of the Legislature protesting the party 's decision .
Meanwhile , senior TMC leaders , at a press conference held here today , said the leadership had taken the decision only after ascertaining the views of the leaders , functionaries and activists individually and collectively .
` ` We have faith that whatever decision Mr. Moopanar took would be in the larger interest of Tamil Nadu , the party and partymen without involvement of any self-interest,' ' said Mr. D. Sudarsanam , MLA , treasurer and Mr. S. G. Vinayagamurthy , vice-president of the party .
Mr. Chokkar , in his resignation letter to the Speaker , said he felt that the party leader ( Mr. Moopanar ) was pressured by many in the top rung of the organisation to take this decision ( support to the AIADMK ) against his conscience .
Mr. Chokkar said that he had resigned his membership of the Assembly as he felt it as a burden at this juncture when the decision of the party had gone against the mandate of the people , ` ` only because some TMC leaders have fallen a prey to the lust for power .
Mr. K. S. Alagiri , MLA and general secretary , said the senior partymen like Mr. P. Chidambaram , D. Sudarsanam and himself had been with Mr. Moopanar for more than two decades and they knew fully well that their leader would not take any decision contrary to the sentiments of partymen .
