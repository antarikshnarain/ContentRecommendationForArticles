Battle for the Republic

Strident upper caste rhetoric against casteism glosses over the 1,000-year-old Manuvadi oppression of the Backward Classes and the republic 's unparalleled , though still incomplete , record of affirmative action , as Other Backward Class patriarchs sabotage the Women 's Reservation Bill in the name of social justice .
People , including intellectuals , prompted by a neo-liberal media have forgotten how a flood of reports including the Hazari Report , Mahalanobis Committee , Monopolies Inquiry Commission , Industrial Licensing Policy Inquiry Committee and Sachar Committee documented the exponential growth of both Indian and foreign big business as a consequence of the license-permit-quota raj .
The continuing attacks on the tiny Christian community as well as the Hindu Kabirpanthis in Jammu , coupled with strident Hindutva rhetoric along with the sustained infiltration of Sangh Parivar activists into State institutions , especially in the educational and media sectors , threaten the republic and its future .
The NDA regime sponsored attempt to rewrite both Indian history and the Constitution is part of the same communal project to convert the republic into an authoritarian , upper caste neo-Brahminical Hindutva state .
The current battles , therefore , between the divided secularists and the consolidated Hindutva parivar - the Sangh Parivar , Shiv Sena , Ananda Marg combine , constitute a battle for the soul of the republic .
Thus the need to recapitulate the republic 's real history and major successes that both Hindutva and neo-liberal ideologues seek to suppress and distort .
