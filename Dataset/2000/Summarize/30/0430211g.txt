'A ploy to divert attention' 

The senior Congress ( I ) leader , Mr. K . Karunakaran , has said that the BJP-led Government 's plan to constitute a committee to review the Constitution is a ploy to divert the attention of the people from its failures .
Speaking to reporters here today , he said the Central Government was going ahead with its plan to set up a committee to review the Constitution with the knowledge that no Government could completely revise it .
Instead of asking for a review of the Constitution , the Central Government should at least name the Articles that they believed were putting obstacles to the stability of the nation , he said .
Stating that the Central Government did not have any programme other that anti-Congressism , Mr. Karunakaran said that there was not even a semblance of unity among the 24 parties in the ruling NDA led by the BJP .
