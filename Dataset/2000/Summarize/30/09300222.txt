A little sunshine, a lot more gloom

In the 1998 Rotterdam Film Festival - where his " Hana-Bi " was shown - he said he was tired of critics asking him about the violence in his pictures , and so he was determined to make one without any .
Amos Gitai 's " Sacred " and Luc Besson 's " Joan of Arc " were undoubtedly way behind Almodovar 's movie , but their searing look at religious practices touched me .
Besson does underline the cruelty that was heaped on the simple lass , but his temptation to picturise the concept in a truly Hollywood style , with loud music and special effects , mars what could have been a powerful attempt at recreating a bit of interesting history .
Besson seems to be getting deeper into this mess : one remembers his " The Fifth Element " some years ago where truly American Bruce Willis chips in his bit to take the director far away from European cinema .
The Spanish creator , Carlos Saura , for one , could have easily bitten into the poison apple : his " Tango " ( seen two years ago at Cannes ) is a tale of deceit , love and envy - all convincingly portrayed through the dance - he relies entirely on Spanish nuances to narrate it .
" The Cloud " is splendidly allegorical , and a peculiar imagery reveals the ills of modernism : the people are walking backward , the cars are moving backward - perhaps signifying the many losses of our times .
