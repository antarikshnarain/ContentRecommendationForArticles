Casting of horoscope

Horoscopes are cast too by using Tables of Ascendants going by Sidereal Time and Local Mean Time .
Birth Star and planetary positions can be calculated and placed in Rasi and Navamsa Charts by referring to the Panchangam and Ephemeris , considering the Nirayana position .
Maha Dasas and Bhukthis are calculated from the time of birth and the Moon 's position , with reference to the total duration of the natal star , and the balance duration yet to elapse at the time of birth .
Good dates : February 3 from 4 p.m. and February 4 upto 6 p.m . * * * Queries answered Astronomers say the Moon is a natural satellite of Earth .
Ramakrishnan R. , Chennai-17 In our astrology not only the Moon , but the Sun which is a star , and the Nodes , Rahu and Kethu , are called " Planets " .
The " Brihad Jataka " does not mention the Nodes as Planets but the " Brihat Samhita " does .
