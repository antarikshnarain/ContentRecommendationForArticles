Mystery trail ends in holy town 

Mr. V. Rajendran , a senior Under Secretary with the Union Defence Ministry who had abruptly disappeared this past week while on the way to his office here , has now been traced to the holy town of Hardwar in Uttar Pradesh where he apparently went in ` ` .... search of the Almighty'' .
Following the arrival of the letter , Mr. Rajendran 's family - comprising his wife and two daughters , Akhila ( 18 ) and Suhasini ( 16 ) - informed the R. K. Puram police station .
Soon after , a police team under the supervision of the Additional Station House Officer of the R. K. Puram police station , Mr . Bahadur Singh , was despatched to Hardwar to try and convince Mr . Rajendran to come back .
The letter talked of Mr. Rajendran 's disillusionment with the world around him and his overall dissatisfaction with life , Mr . Kamraj said , adding that he had not mentioned any particular reason for his sudden departure to Hardwar .
The letter was very religious and philosophical in content and talked about Mr. Rajendran 's feeling of closeness to God,' ' Mr. Kamraj said .
A case of abduction had been registered as a matter of utmost caution as he was not only a Defence Ministry official but also part of the Ministry 's team for the Republic Day Parade down Rajpath .
