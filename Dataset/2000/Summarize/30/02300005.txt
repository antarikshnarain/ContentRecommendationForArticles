Sonia warns against regressive forces 

Though they made so much of the Indian culture , they had nothing to do with the country 's cultural values and humanity , Ms. Gandhi said at a function held at the Town Hall here to mark the 700th birth anniversay of the Vaishno saint , Swami Ramanand .
Ms. Gandhi said Swami Ramanand had taught the people of the country the ideals of social equality and tolerance and his pupils were drawn from different sections of the society without any discrimination of caste , sex and religion .
Ms. Gandhi said Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were closely associated with the Ramanand Math of Varanasi and they tried to follow the saint 's teachings .
