PSU staff to go on strike on Feb. 2 

Claiming that the meeting could not come to any positive conclusion ` ` as the Minister did not give any commitment on the issues involved in the strike notice' ' , the five Central trade unions , in a joint statement , asked the workers to proceed with the strike as scheduled .
The five unions- AITUC , CITU , HMS , UTUC ( LS ) and UTUC- said issues raised in the strike notice given by the Committee of Public Sector Trade Unions were discussed at some length at the meeting .
