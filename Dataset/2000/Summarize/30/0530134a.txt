The junta scores 

Not surprisingly , Myanmar 's governing State Peace and Development Council ( SPDC ) has found itself on the winning side during the latest seizure of a hospital complex in Thailand by a band of rebels opposed to the Yangon junta itself and the decisive counter-terrorist action that Bangkok took to bring the crisis to a successful end .
Following the latest rescue of several hundred Thai hostages from what turned out to be the loose clutches of 10 anti-SPDC militants , all belonging to Myanmar despite the fact that some of them did not wish to owe allegiance to that country , Yangon lost no time in commending the action taken by the Chuan Government .
On January 24 , ten gunmen , all believed at that time to be members of the so-called ` ` God 's Army' ' of anti-Myanmar Karen rebels , seized a large hospital complex at Ratchaburi and took all the several hundred people hostage.The gunmen , who were killed by an elite commando team of Thai military and police personnel in a pre-dawn swoop on January 25 , had asked Bangkok to stop shelling the hilltop positions of the Karen rebels inside neigbouring Myanmar .
The genesis was that the Myanmarese troops had launched a major offensive against those Karen posts about a week prior to the latest hostage drama , and Bangkok 's military resorted to a barrage of warning fire to prevent the Karens from using Thailand as a base for tactical or actual retreat .
Quite apart from normative international law , Mr. Chuan 's current compulsions were determined by the need to befriend Yangon , a colleague in the Association of South East Asian Nations , in the context of the SPDC 's ire over Thailand 's act of organising a ` ` guided safe passage' ' for the gunmen of the ` ` Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors' ' as a reward for releasing those they took hostage in a seizure of the Myanmarese embassy in Bangkok last October .
Unresolved by this week-end were suspicions that the latest hostage drama might have been enacted entirely by the pro- democracy ` ` Warriors' ' who were given sanctuary by the ` ` God 's Army' ' in the wake of their embassy seizure last October .
