Heroes' welcome to under-19 champs

A reception befitting the world champion was accorded to the Indian under-19 cricket team , which returned from Colombo on Saturday evening after annexing the World Cup on Friday .
Once the minor irritants were removed , Prof. Nandakumar said , the boys went from strength to strength and did ` ` remarkably well .
Prof. Nandakumar said the team had to perform before a crowd of 25,000 on the final day rooting for the home side .
Skipper Mohammad Kaif termed the outcome as a result of ` ` team effort' ' and paid rich tributes to the role played by the coach , Roger Binny .
While admitting it would be invidious to name this or that player as outstanding , Kaif pinpointed the splendid role played by Saulab Srivastav and Mrutyunjay Tripathi on the tour .
