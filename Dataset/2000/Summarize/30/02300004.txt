Bajrang Dal to raise anti-terrorist teams

Christian missionaries who carried out conversions and the abettors of Islamic fundamentalism in the country would face a more militant action from the Hindutva forces , the Bajrang Dal leader , Mr. Harish Bhai Bhatt , warned on Saturday .
At a press conference here , the Dal 's national general secretary said the organisation had plans to train Hindu youth in ` ` every way' ' to counter the threat of the missionaries and Islamic fundamentalists .
The construction of a Ram mandir at the disputed site in Ayodhya within the next two years and raising teams of highly- trained Hindu youth to counter ISI-sponsored terrorism and its abettors were the priorities of the Dal , he said .
Mr. Bhatt said that neither the Dal nor the Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( VHP ) needed the ` ` sanction , approval , permission or help' ' of the Centre and State Governments in constructing the Ram temple .
The convention of the Dal in Bhopal next month would pave the way for militant Hindutva action against all past mistakes of the Islamic rulers and ` ` every temple , place of worship or any site' ' converted into Muslim worship places would be liberated and original temples restored .
Criticising the Government for ` ` begging the United States and others to declare Pakistan as a terrorist state' ' , he said ` ` instead we must ourselves declare it so and take punitive action against it .
