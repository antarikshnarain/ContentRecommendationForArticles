China releases scholar 

The scholar , Mr. Song Yongyi , a research librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle , Pennsylvania , was detained in August while collecting documents concerning the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that are widely available in markets and curio shops .
Together , the two groups waged a vigorous campaign to gain the release of Mr. Song , a Chinese citizen who had been scheduled to become an American citizen weeks after he had been detained .
A statement issued on Friday by the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Mr. Song had been shown ` ` leniency' ' and not prosecuted because he had admitted his ` ` criminal activities' ' and had volunteered information about the ` ` illegal activities of others .
The ` ` leniency' ' release is a bittersweet victory for many of Mr. Song 's dogged supporters , who saw his predicament as a test case not only for academic freedom , but also for legal reform in China .
` ` Given the state of the process of Chinese judicial reform,' ' Mr. Arlen Specter , Republican Senator from Pennsylvania , said , ` ` I think it would be too much to expect that they 'd admit to having made a mistake .
' ' Mr. Specter had sponsored a Congressional resolution to demand that Mr. Song be freed , and he received the first official news of the release at a scheduled meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to Washington .
