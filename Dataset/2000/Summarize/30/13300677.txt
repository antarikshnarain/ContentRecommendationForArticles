The genius of Pablo Neruda

IF Pablo Neruda 's recent fame in this country has been largely achieved on the basis of his love poems , which in turn received a fillip from the movies that romanticised his life , " II Postino " , it is time we did better with one of the greatest poets of our time .
Macchu Picchu is one of the fabled lost cities of the Incas , perched on two peaks ( Macchu Picchu and Huayna Picchu ) overlooking the Urubamba river .
" The Heights Of Macchu Picchu " is a poem in 12 sections in which the poet makes " a kind of pilgrimage through human life in search of meaningful truth " .
In his introduction to this edition , Robert Pring-Mill writes : " When Neruda does reach Macchu Picchu , its heights turn out to be the place from which all else makes sense , including his own continent " .
Take for example this verse that opens Section II in which the poet contrasts man with nature - nature is generous , self perpetuating while man is driven to impoverish himself : Flower to flower delivers up its seed and rock maintains its blossom broadcast in a bruised garment of diamond and sand yet man crumples the petal of the light he skims from the predetermined sources of the sea and drills the pulsing metal in his hands soon , caught between clothes and smoke , on the sunken floor , the soul 's reduced to a shuffled pack , quartz and insomnia , tears in the sea , like pools of cold - yet this is not enough : he kills , confesses it on paper with contempt , muffles it in the rug of habit , shreds it in a hostile apparel of wire .
For me the poem really picks up when it gets to Section IV where he poet actually gets to Macchu Picchu : Then up the ladder of the earth I climbed Through the barbed jungle 's thickets Until I reached you Macchu Picchu .
