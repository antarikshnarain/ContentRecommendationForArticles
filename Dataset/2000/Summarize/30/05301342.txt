Darkness over the Valley 

Earlier caught in the crossfire of militants and security forces , the hapless Kashmiris are now witness to the exchange of allegations and counter-allegations between Dr . Farooq Abdullah 's National Conference regime and the Centre .
In fact , the general feeling is that the NC Government had developed a contemptous attitude towards Kashmiris , notwithstanding the fact that after seven years of death and destruction , they again embraced the party in 1996 with the hope that the much-talked-about ` ` Kashmiriat' ' was still alive in it , though its leaders took refuge outside the Valley in the bad days .
Challenges to the NC regime are increasing with each passing day , the latest being the total breakdown in power supply to the Valley as a result of two bomb blasts at transmission towers at Uri and Qazigund .
Starting with the attack on the BSF headquarters at Bandipore , they have inflicted heavy losses - at the Badamibagh Cantonment where the Defence PRO , Major P. Purushottam , was killed alongwith seven others , at the Special Operations Group office at Khanabal and the latest being at Tatoo Ground .
Though there has been an increase in militant activities , putting the security forces on tenterhooks , so far there have not been the scenes of jubilation among the people as was seen after the release of five top JKLF leaders in exchange for Rubaiya Sayeed in 1989 .
Mainstream politicians , including NC men who have been the main target of militants , have chosen to lie low ; even separatist politicians concede that militancy has taken centre stage relegating them to the background .
