Resolution moved to brand Pak. a terrorist state

A resolution branding Pakistan a terrorist state has been referred to the United States ' House International Relations Committee , amid suggestions from the Clinton administration that Islamabad could face such action if it continues to support militant groups .
` ` Besides the terrorist organisations themselves , those countries that harbour terrorist organisations or provide them with technical , financial , political or other support should be held accountable,' ' the Democratic Congressman , Mr. Frank Pallone , said introducing the resolution in the house on Friday .
The various clauses of the resolution noted that reports from Western media sources had cited Pakistan as a base and training ground for terrorist groups , and that Pakistan 's Government had demonstrated a reluctance to halt the use of its soil for terrorist organisations .
The House International Relations Committee Chairman , Mr . Benjamin Gilman , has also urged the Clinton administration to declare Afghanistan 's Taliban a ` ` terrorist movement' ' and put Pakistan on notice that if it did not cut its strings with the Taliban , then the same would happen to it .
