An Andy Ram act all the way 

Sure enough , Ram made favourite Svarc look like a non-performer in bagging the singles title in the TNTA'75- Futures men 's tennis championship at the Nungambakkam Stadium .
As though to reinforce that it was his moment or rather Israel 's day in the championship , Ram , partnering Nir Welgreen annexed the doubles title also , beating the Slovakian pair of Ladislav Svarc and Boris Borgula in three tiring sets .
For a player like Svarc , who seemed to be riding on the crest of success from the way he had galloped to the summit round in keeping with his top seeding status , Ram 's was a sort of mesmerizing act that he had not bargained for .
A fighter to the core , Svarc smelt a possible success coming in that crucial game , but his erratic play undid his intentions and Ram grabbed a huge advantage by winning the opening set .
The fight , Ram repeated that in the ninth game to finish off Svarc in such an emphatic way that he richly deserved the $ 1,300 prize money for the singles and another $ 315 as his share in the doubles win .
The results ( all final ) : singles : Andy Ram ( ISR ) bt Ladislav Svarc ( SVK ) 6- 4 , 6-3 .
