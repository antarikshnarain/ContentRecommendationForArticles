A tribute to Kargil heroes 

The massed band played ` ` Abide With Me...' ' and the bells tolled in the background of the majestic expanse of Rashtrapati Bhavan as the National Tricolour was lowered respectfully this evening in the presence of the President - who is also the Supreme Commander of the nation 's Defence Forces - bringing to a close the Republic Day celebrations .
The ceremonial ` ` Beating Retreat' ' which unfolded at Vijay Chowk was a tribute to the heroes of Kargil with two new tunes dedicated to the brave soldiers .
Both the tunes , ` ` Vir Kargil' ' and ` ` Mushko Valley' ' , played by the military band , were composed by Major ( retd ) Nazir Hussain .
The pipers and drummers mesmerised the audience with their amazing coordination of tunes and staccato movement of feet on both quick and slow marches .
The military band paid a rich tribute to its soldiers for their valour in Kargil by playing two new tunes , ` ` Vir Kargil and Mushko Valley' .
Composed by W . H. Monk , ` ` Abide with me...' ' the favourite tune of the Father of the Nation , began sharp at sunset and the flag was downed and folded by the time the notes ended .
