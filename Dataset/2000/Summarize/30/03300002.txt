''Clinton will not interfere in India's affairs''

The U.S. State Department has made it clear that the President , Mr. Bill Clinton 's desire to work for defusing the crisis between India and Pakistan does not mean any kind of interference in India 's affairs or , in any way , harming its interest .
To a question about the President 's observation to this effect in his State of the Union address on Thursday , the U.S. State Department 's Deputy Director of Policy Planning , Mr . James C. O'Brien , on Friday said , ` ` I do n't think he ( Mr . Clinton ) was proposing anything that in any way runs against the interests of the Indian Government .
' ' ` ` So , I would warn you against interpreting anything he said as a suggestion of U.S. meddling where it 's not wanted,' ' he said to the question by an Indian journalist .
' ' Asked whether Mr. Clinton would visit Pakistan during his visit to South Asia in the spring , Mr. O'Brien said the Secretary of State , Ms. Madeleine Albright , would make a recommendation about it .
' ' When asked as to why India and Pakistan should listen to the U.S . advice to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) when it had failed to ratify the pact , Mr. O'Brien said the international norm in the CTBT provided protection for all people in the world , and ` ` it does that by laying down a rule that impedes the development of nuclear weapons by forbidding a particular means of developing them , the testing .
` ` We 're maintaining that moratorium even after the Senate action , and I think , thus , by our actions , we are reflecting a commitment to the norm that lies at the heart of the non-proliferation regime .
