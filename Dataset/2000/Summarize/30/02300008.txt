Cong.(I) confident of returning to power in Orissa 

Terming the BJP-BJD combine a ` ` paper tiger' ' , Mr. Patnaik said the Congress ( I ) alone could provide a stable government , which was required to rebuild the State which suffered two cyclones last year .
In all likelihood , of the 147 seats , the Congress ( I ) would contest 145 , leaving the remaining two for the Janata Dal ( U ) and the Janta Dal ( S ) .
As many as 12 sitting MLAs and Ministers had been refused ticket for the ensuing polls , prominent among them being the Finance Minister , Mr. Bhagabat Prasad Mohanty , and the Panchayati Raj Minister , Mr. Raghunath Patnaik .
` ` The final decision was taken by the Central Election Committee in New Delhi,' ' Mr. Patnaik said , when asked to specify the reasons for denial of the tickets to Mr. Mohanty and Mr. Patnaik .
The sitting MLAs who had declined to contest were Mr. Giridhar Gamang and Ms. Nandini Satpathy , both former Chief Ministers , Mr . Prasanna Mishra , former Assembly Speaker , and Mr. Bibhudendra Pratap Das .
Even though there is resentment among the sitting MLAs and Ministers who have been denied the tickets , the Congress ( I ) looks hopeful of benefiting of the problems within the BJP-BJD alliance .
