Naxals blast police station building

Naxalites belonging to the outlawed CPI ( ML ) People 's War Group blasted a new building meant for police station at Vajrakarur , a mandal headquarters about 65 km from here , in the district in the wee hours of Saturday .
Fifteen to 20 armed naxalites belonging to the Penna Ahobilam dalam went to the building which was completed recently , around 1.30 am and detonated it after planting gelatine sticks in buckets , police said .
The naxalites left a note at the site stating that it was in retaliation for the killing of Mr. Nalla Adireddy in a ` ` fake encounter' ' in Karimnagar district a couple of months ago .
Police , who went to the blast site only in the morning , found a bucket used for planting the gelatine sticks and an axe left behind by the naxalites .
Mohan Rao , who visited the blast site , said the naxalites would not achieve anything by blasting buildings of police stations and other government buildings .
The torching of a microwave station at Regulapadu between Uravakonda and Vajrakarur in November 1993 was the first violent act of the naxalites in the area .
