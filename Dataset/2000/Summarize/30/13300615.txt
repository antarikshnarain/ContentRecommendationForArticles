Making women disappear

On the day that the " born winners " were featured on the front page - three identical smiles under crystal crowns - there was a page one anchor story with the headline : " Meri eyes bhi sexy , mera pout bhi sexy " .
On the day that the front pages of some newspapers carried news of the three beauty queens,a small item inside spoke of how women bus conductors in Andhra Pradesh were being taught karate .
Because after the first rush for a job which had earlier been a male domain , women realised that to be a bus conductor and a woman meant facing not just abuse and sexual harassment from male passengers but also molestation and sexual assault .
And yet again , on the same day as this report appeared , the op-ed ( opposite the edit page ) page of one newspaper had an article , prominently displayed , lifted from a British newspaper , with the headline " Learn to flirt and turn your life around .
According to a study conducted in a fairly prosperous area of Gujarat , Kheda district,by Leela Visaria and some others , out of 346 women interviewed , 66 per cent reported that they had been subjected to verbal or physical violence in their marital homes .
Meanwhile the real world , where women bus conductors must learn karate,where women in prosperous rural areas must silently bear verbal and physical abuse , remains hidden .
