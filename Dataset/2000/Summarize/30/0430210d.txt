Roads: Rs. 1,400-cr. World Bank aid likely 

1,400 crores for upgradation and improvement works of around 1,800 km of State highways and some district roads .
He said the State highways , which were now around 20 mm thick , would be strengthened to a thickness of 80 mm and this by itself would ensure that they were all-weather roads and could withstand heavier axle loads .
45 lakhs per km. , the cost of upgrading the State highways into wider and better roads apart from constructing drainages alongside would cost Rs .
While Mr. Christopher Huban and Mr. Ashok Bhansal , officials of the World Bank were here on Friday for a preliminary round of talks , the Country Director , Mr. Edwin Lim , would be here with an 18-member team on February 8 .
They were the Jewargi ( Gulbarga district ) -Sankeshwar ( Belgaum ) stretch of 270 km , and the Bijapur-Hubli stretch of 191 km , the Kalamala ( Raichur district ) - Ginigara ( Koppal district ) stretch of 167 km and the Bidar-Hiriyur section ( 529 km ) of the proposed Bidar- Srirangapatna national highway of 740 km .
