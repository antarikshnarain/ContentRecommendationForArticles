Cong. wants clarity in Kashmir policy 

The Congress ( I ) has expressed grave concern at the deteriorating situation in Jammu and Kashmir and demanded that the Centre prepare a coherent , well thought-out policy in the State .
The primary duty of the Government is to inform the country about the specific steps it intended to take to curb and terminate the unabated terrorist activity in the State , he said .
In the absence of a well-defined anti-terrorist policy , the security forces were hampered in their duties and had themselves become subject to intense terrorist attacks .
