Quest for identity

Hyderabad , the venue for the ninth National Conference on Women 's Studies held early this month , proved that as long as women 's studies keeps its dynamic link with the contemporary women 's movement , it will remain an area of inquiry which is alive and relevant .
" There is a myth " , she said , " that tribal societies are very egalitarian because we ( tribal women ) are visible and mobile .
Similarly , the government 's attempt to " help " tribals by upgrading technology by introducing shuttle looms , for instance , to replace the traditional pit looms , has forced women to give up weaving altogether as they were not comfortable with the change .
Other policies , such as promoting IMFL ( Indian Made Foreign Liquor ) in places like Arunachal have " eaten into the resources of the family because men are hooked to it and women are forced to take on more responsibility " , she said .
For instance , the Supreme Court judgment which granted tribal women the right to inheritance , otherwise denied to them under customary law , was greeted with hostility by the male leadership of the movement who saw it as a plot by non-tribals and " westernised feminists " to attack tribal customary rights .
But it could also divide the movement if it works on the assumption that only those born into a social group can understand , and therefore articulate questions relating to women 's rights in that particular group and that there are no " non-negotiable " rights that apply to all women , irrespective of class , caste or community .
