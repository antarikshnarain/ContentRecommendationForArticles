Trim and ambiguous

Historically , with both the Prasar Bharati Act and the Broadcasting Bill in its earlier avatar - the draft that Mr Jaipal Reddy had introduced in Parliament in May 1997 - the tendency was to be specific on crucial issues such as conditions for giving licences , Direct To Home ( DTH ) , appointment of the members of the authority , cross media restrictions and foreign equity .
The original broadcasting bill of 1997 provided a schedule at the end of the bill which spelt out who was disqualified from holding a licence ( foreigners , companies with foreign equity ) , what restrictions there would be to prevent monopolies , and what restrictions there would be on cross media interests .
There have been earlier drafts of this Government 's bill , and whereas one of them had put foreign equity permitted in broadcasting at over 70 per cent , the draft that has gone to the Minister of Information and Broadcasting , Mr. Arun Jaitley , does not mention the issue of foreign equity in so many words .
These services are terrestrial radio broadcasting , terrestrial television broadcasting , satellite radio broadcasting , satellite TV broadcasting , DTH broadcasting , local delivery services and such other services as may be prescribed .
These rules will provide for eligibility and disqualification for holding licences , restrictions to prevent accumulation of interests in licensed services , restrictions on holding licences or controlling interest in both broadcasting and distribution services , and restrictions on controlling interests in both newspapers and licensed services .
Whether or not cable and satellite channel licences can be held by the same party , whether newspaper and magazine owners can also have TV or radio channels in their area of circulation , whether or not foreign companies can get satellite licences , and if so with what percentage of foreign equity - all this has been left to the discretion of the government of the day .
