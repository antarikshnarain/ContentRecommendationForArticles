Saba Karim is ready and waiting

When he started playing at the first class level , Syed Kirmani was still around , but Saba Karim is still fighting for a berth in the Indian team with third generation of wicketkeepers like M.S.K .
In his early years , Kirmani was out of the team but trying desperately to make a comeback ; then there were Kiran More , Chandrakant Pandit and Sadanand Viswanath , all good keepers in their own right .
Thus Saba Karim got a national call only after about four years at the domestic level , for a tour of the West Indies , but was again out of favour till a couple of seasons back .
An unbeaten 102 against Central Zone and a 98 against West Zone were crucial knocks , which separated Saba Karim from the rest of the 'keepers in the premier one day tournament of the country .
Saba Karim is definitely one of the most experienced campaigners at the domestic level , who is happy that there are more opportunities now .
If the Deodhar Trophy is a barometer , then Saba Karim is definitely a contender for the wicketkeeper 's job .
