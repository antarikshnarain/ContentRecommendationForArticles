Indonesian forces put on alert

The Indonesian military ( TNI ) has been put on high alert to prevent disturbances during the foreign tour by the President , Mr. Abdurrahman Wahid , who left Jakarta yesterday amid unabated unrest in several parts of the country .
The Speaker of the People 's Consultative Assembly , Mr. Amien Rais , and the Speaker of the House of Representatives , Mr. Akbar Tandjung , met Mr. Wahid prior to his departure and asked him to monitor the situation in the country on an hourly basis during his visit to 13 countries .
The President , as also several leading politicians and the Defence Minister , Mr. Juwono Sudarsono , have discounted rumours of any coup attempt by the TNI during Mr. Wahid 's foreign tour which began yesterday with a visit to Saudi Arabia .
On a different front , the Indonesian Government-backed Commission on Human Rights Violations in East Timor ( KPP-HAM ) has indicated that it found Gen. Wiranto , formerly the TNI commander and at present the Senior Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs , morally responsible for the carnage that took place in East Timor in September .
Observers and analysts expect the U.N . panel to indict elements within the TNI , while Jakarta has pleaded with the global organisation not to constitute an international tribunal to scrutinise the conduct of Indonesian generals .
