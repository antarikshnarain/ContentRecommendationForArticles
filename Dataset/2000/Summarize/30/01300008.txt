A conspiracy: Scindia

Senior Congress ( I ) leader , Mr. Madhavrao Scindia , today said Mr. Ram Prakash Gupta 's assertion on Friday that his Government would allow the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya , confirms fears that the BJP , backed by the Sangh Parivar combine , is intent on pursuing its hidden agenda .
` ` The systematic manner in which the BJP is going ahead with its agenda , despite denials at every step , only smacks of a deep- seated conspiracy aimed at changing the secular fibre of the country,' ' Mr. Scindia said in a statement today .
Pranab 's concern Another CWC member and the chairman of the Congress ( I ) 's media department , Mr. Pranab Mukherjee , also joined issue with Mr . Gupta saying he must be aware of the fact that no construction could commence at the disputed site at Ayodhya because the matter was sub judice .
` ` To say that the construction of the Ram temple will be allowed if it is ` peaceful ' just as the demolition of Babri Masjid was ` peaceful ' betrays and exposes the real and mala fide intentions of the BJP,' ' he said .
` ` A Chief Minister who violates elementary norms of running an administration can not continue in office and the non-BJP parties in the NDA should explain their stand on a blatantly communal and disruptive statement from a BJP chief minister,' ' the CPI ( M ) politburo said .
