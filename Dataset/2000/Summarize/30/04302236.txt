'HC against permanent shops in uzhavar sandhai' 

A Division Bench of the Madras High Court has ordered that farmers should not be allowed to have permanent shops in the ` uzhavar sandhai ' ( farmers shandy ) , coming up at R.S .
Puram , on the ground that it would cause pollution and traffic congestion , the Bench asked the municipal officials to keep the area ` ` clean and tidy' ' and remove the waste ` ` every now and then'' .
The farmers would be allowed to sell their products between 6 a.m and 11 a.m , the Bench noted .
The petitioners , all residents of Coimbatore said the ` ` uzhavar sandhai' ' had been proposed to be set up by the local authorities in the land , which had been earmarked as educational zone in the master plan under the Town and Country Planning Act .
The market would function only between 6 a.m and 11 a.m and farmers would not be allowed to sell their products in the shandy after 11 a.m .
As regards alleged violation of the Town and Country Planning Act , the Bench said it did not find any force in the argument , as under the relevant zone it was mentioned that petty shops dealing in daily essentials like provisions , soft drinks , cigarettes , newspapers and milk could be permitted in the zone .
