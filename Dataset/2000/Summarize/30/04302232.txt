CGHS: No relief for beneficiaries 

The Central Government Health Scheme ( CGHS ) on which retirees and in-service Government employees alike depend for medicare , appears to be an ailing behemoth in Chennai , due to shortage of doctors and untimely supply of medicines .
Modelled on the lines of the United Kingdom 's National Health Service , its beneficiaries range from senior government servants , IAS and IPS officials , MPs , judges , freedom fighters and pensioners besides their dependents .
Only one local chemist firm is on contract to serve the 14 dispensaries though earlier each dispensary had its own chemist .
In some cases , they are purchased by the beneficiaries , many of whom can not afford to pay cash for the costly drugs , and reimbursement is sought later , though the dispensaries do obtain the medicines for patients .
The Additional Director , CGHS , Chennai , Dr. M. V. Ranga Reddy , said that the reimbursement could be sought at his office as well , and ` ` emergency requisition slips' ' were provided at the dispensaries for purchase of medicine within 24 hours .
Denying that reimbursement claims were pending since 1998 , he said whatever was pending was awaiting ` ` headquarter 's sanction,' ' a situation that does not provide much relief for the beneficiaries .
