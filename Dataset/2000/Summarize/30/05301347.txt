Playing big brother? 

The Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission presents detailed accounts of crimes committed by the apartheid regime against the Governments and people of nine countries of the southern African region : Angola , Botswana , Lesotho , Mozambique , Swaziland , Seychelles , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
Both Angola and the DRC have accused South Africa , which has been urging an ` ` inclusive' ' settlement in both the cases and has played host to the rebels , of actively or covertly supporting the rebels .
The question is important in the light of the initiatives being taken by South Africa ( Northern Ireland , East Timor , Palestine , Lockerbie ) of its own volition and in response to pleas by the ` ` international community' ' as mediator and facilitator in conflict resolution , often accompanied by much media hype .
The recent accusations by Mr. Kabila that South Africa is openly and covertly supporting the rebels have to be viewed in the context of this unique role that has been both assigned to , and assumed by , South Africa .
Indeed , in September last year , the Deputy Foreign Minister of Angola called for ` ` international sanctions' ' against South Africa , along with Burkina Faso , Uganda , Ukraine and Zambia , accusing them of not adhering to the U.N.-imposed sanctions against Unita .
This would be , however , a superficial and perhaps even a cynical view , though one should also note that the now no more new South Africa has absorbed and made its own many of the most detested symbols and even the substance of the apartheid regime - the most obvious being those abominations of the old regime such as Parliament and the judicial system .
