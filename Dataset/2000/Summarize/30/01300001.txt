BJP reaches deal on Orissa, Haryana

As per the agreement late on Friday night between the Biju Janata Dal and the BJP , the BJD would contest 84 seats and the BJP the remaining 63 .
In Orissa the BJP had pitched its demand for 50 per cent of the share and brought it down to 70 seats but the BJD took a tough stand and insisted on being the dominant partner .
The INLD president and the Haryana Chief Minister , Mr. Om Prakash Chauthala and the Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister , Mr . Pramod Mahajan , were engaged in hectic parleys till the wee hours of Friday and they appear to have clinched the deal though the state unit leaders of BJP are fuming over what they term as ` sell-out ' by the high command .
The scene with regard to Bihar where the nomination for the second phase of election in the state is to end on Monday continues to be hazy though the BJP leaders claimed here today that the differences among the allies of the NDA have narrowed down ` substantially' .
The BJP general secretary , Mr. M. Venkaiah Naidu , told reporters here today that there was a meeting among the leaders of the NDA at the residence of the Union Finance Minister , Mr. Yashwant Sinha , on Friday night and the talks were continuing at the residence of the Defence Minister , Mr. George Fernandes , as the Finance Minister had to leave for Davos to attend the meeting of the World Economic Forum .
A senior leader of the BJP claimed here that of the 324 seats in Bihar , there was complete agreement among the NDA allies on 205 seats .
