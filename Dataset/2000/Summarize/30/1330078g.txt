Poet with his feet on the ground 

ABDUL RAHMAN DR. RAHMAN talks of the new trends in Tamil poetry , the space for film lyricists in the literary world and the relevance of Vedas and Upanishads vis-a-vis poetry .
The announcement of the 1999 Sahitya Akademi award for the Tamil poet and scholar , Dr. Rahman ( 62 ) , must have been a poetic irony for him as he has been severe in criticising the Akademi for not choosing poets for the award .
Not only are a large volume of works created and considerable amount of space devoted to poetry in the mainstream Press , journals seek the works of those poets , who have otherwise been contributing to ` ` little magazines'' .
Calling himself a neo-classicist , Dr. Rahman , who worked as the Head of Tamil Department of Islamiah College in Vaniyambadi for several years , says these days , he devotes time to read the Vedas and Upanishads , whose literary value is immense .
Recipient of several awards and honours such as the State Government 's ` Kalaimamani ' title ( 1989 ) , and ` Agni Akshara ' Award ( 1992 ) , the seasoned writer contends that film lyrics are also one form of poetry .
One of Dr. Rahman 's poems ` ` Pyramids in the Desert' ' goes thus : The leaders also die like all of us But , the leaders ' death alone becomes irreparable loss Still , the thrones are not kept vacant .
