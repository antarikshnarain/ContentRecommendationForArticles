Can't a hundred flowers bloom? 

Every time the issue of more internal democracy is raised the CPI ( M ) leadership responds by saying that no other party is more democratic than it , and that no decision is taken without a thorough debate at various levels .
` ` Democratic centralism' ' , according to party theoreticians , takes care of divergent viewpoints and to allege that the CPI ( M ) is a ` ` closed' ' party where the minority view is shut out is sheer disinformation .
The same charge was made against Mr. Saifuddin Chaudhury - he was said to have ` ` hobnobbed' ' with the Congress ( I ) in 1993 when the CPI ( M ) 's official position was to oppose the party with the same zeal as the BJP.Mr .
Chaudhury was dropped from the party 's central committee and denied ticket for the 1996 Lok Sabha elections as a punishment for advocating a softer line towards the Congress ( I ) vis-a-vis the BJP , though two years later the CPI ( M ) ended up doing exactly the same thing .
Two others - the West Bengal Transport Minister , Mr. Subhas Chakraborty , and the district secretary of North 24 Paraganas , Mr. Samir Putatunda - have been reprimanded for calling for greater democracy within the party ; and a ` ` rectification' ' drive is on to bring the ` ` heretics' ' back on track .
The rise of the Trinamul Congress in West Bengal , initially dismissed by the CPI ( M ) leadership as a flash in the pan , owes itself to the widespread disillusionment with the CPI ( M ) not only among the people but also within the party 's own ranks .
