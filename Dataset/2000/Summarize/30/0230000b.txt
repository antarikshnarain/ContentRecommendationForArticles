Elitist approach led to TRAI's downfall 

Even politicians and parties like the Telugu Desam Party , who were sympathetic to the previous Justice Sodhi-headed dispensation in the TRAI , turned lukewarm to pleas for their continuance once it was succinctly explained how their recommendations would harm the National Telecom Policy 's primary objective of increasing tele-density and making phones affordable to the common man .
According to official sources , the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications was recently explained the harmful implications of some of the TRAI 's recommendations , particularly those relating to phone rates and the controversial ` calling party pays ' scheme for mobile phones , struck down recently by the courts on grounds of jurisdiction .
First , the new phone rates were announced by the TRAI in March 1999 after disregarding the ground realities such as the need to channel extra revenue from long-distance call charges to fund the expansion of telecom in rural areas .
Pointing out that tariffs are the most important tool for determining the level of funds available for investment , officials say had the TRAI been allowed to revise tariffs twice over the next two years , the target of achieving tele-density of seven per 1,000 people by the year 2005 would be unachievable .
While attempting to emasculate the main objective of spreading the use of phones by the Government sector , the TRAI turned a blind eye to the failure by private fixed phone companies to abide by their commitment of providing 10 per cent of phones in rural areas .
The TRAI 's norms for revenue-sharing between fixed phone companies and cellular companies under which 80 per cent of the income from calls made from DoT/MTNL phones to cellular phones was also against the interest of the consumers .
