The season that was

What started off as a move by highly motivated people during the 1927 AICC session , to counter the influence of western culture , fast luring into its vortex the younger element , has over the years , burgeoned into the massive classical music and dance spread , offered by ever increasing number of Sabhas all over Chennai .
* * * Even a rare event like the exhibition of over 200 photographs and other illustrative material on the theme of " Yearning for the Spiritual Ideal : Indian Influence on Western Dance ( 1626-1999 ) " mounted in the foyer of the Narada Gana Sabha Gyanananda Hall , drew a very disappointing number of people .
Now at the top of the chart are young names like T. M. Krishna , Sanjay Subramaniam and P . Unnikrishnan with veterans like K. S. Narayanasamy and Lalgudi Jayaraman ( among the instrumentalists ) and T. N. Krishnan with the likes of O. S. Thyagarajan , T. N. Seshagopalan ( to mention only a few ) forming the steady core with a committed following .
A fast teermanam rendered with less than impeccable rhythm , often invites warm applause in the middle of a varnam while brilliantly set sequences rendered with rhythm control the madhyam laya , and an aesthetic feel for well coordinated nattuvangam and dance , will draw little audience reaction .
While its main platforms are provided by Sri Krishna Gana Sabha , Narada Gana Sabha , Bharat Kalachar and Kartik Fine Arts , the Fine Arts Society and Nungambakkam Cultural Centre also provide some slots for dance .
While dancers like A. Lakshman , Rajesh and Zakkir Hussein were featured in Sabhas like the Krishna Gana Sabha and Narada Gana Sabha , a dancer like Narendra had only one slot and that as Krishna in the dance drama 'Mahaabhaarata' .
