Mohun Bagan puts up an impressive show

Mohun Bagan brightened its title hopes with a 3-1 verdict over Manaksia Tollygunge Agragami in their concluding first phase encounter of the National Football League here at the Ravindra Sarovar Stadium on Saturday .
Agragami , which began its NFL campaign with a win over Kingfisher East Bengal and emerged the best among the Calcutta teams tallying 10 points from three wins and a draw after the fourth round , now finds itself languishing in the ninth spot .
The match today enthralled almost a capacity crowd of around 17,000 as Mohun Bagan , after playing five ` away ' matches on the trot in a protracted outstation assignment of around 20 days , came up with another home win today .
The home crowd also had the first sight of the team 's two latest recruits , Igor Shkivirin and Brazilian Jose Rameirez Barreto , who had set the real difference as Bagan successfully negotiated its Goa rivals Salgaocar , Dempo and Churchill Brothers in Goa .
Continuing its total domination in the match , Bagan found Stephan Abarowei in a new role as the Nigerian forward put a brilliant left-footed finish on a rebound of his own shot in the 16th minute that had come off a Agragami defender ( 2-0 ) .
The Nigerian forward , who was located with a piercing through- pass by Barreto in the 51st minute , cleared his marker with a body feint and drew the Agragami custodian , Bivas Ghosh , wide on the left before angling his shot past the far post to make it a spectacular goal .
