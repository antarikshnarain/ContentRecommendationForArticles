Bajaj  Auto has announced a net profit of Rs. 128.64  crores  for 
the  quarter ended December 31, 1999 against Rs. 97.86 crores  in 
the  corresponding  period of the previous year.  Net  sales  and 
income  from operations were higher at Rs. 997.28 crores  against 
Rs.  849.24  crores. Other income was at Rs.  74.51  crores  (Rs. 
37.82  crores). Total sales were at Rs. 1,071.77  crores  against

After providing Rs. 61 lakhs (Rs. 1.06 crores) for interest,  the 
gross  profit,  amounted  to Rs. 222.26  crores  from  Rs.  172.8 
crores. The company provided Rs. 38.82 crores (Rs. 33.24  crores) 
for depreciation and Rs. 57 crores (Rs. 42 crores) for tax.

quarter  were  3.54 lakh units (3.40 lakh units)  and  3.74  lakh 
units (3.29 lakh units) respectively. 

According  to a company release, the encouraging  performance  in 
the  third  quarter over the same period last year was led  by  a 
reversal  in the decline in scooter sales. Scooter  volumes  have 
grown almost 4.6 per cent on a quarter to quarter basis. This  is 
primarily  due to innovative sales schemes like `Bajaj  Crorepati 
Hungama' and newer products like Bravo and Legend accounting  for 
almost  15  per  cent  of total scooter  sales.  There  was  also 
impressive growth of over 110 per cent in the scooterette segment 
led by Spirit and a growth of 16 per cent in the step-thru market 
after  the  launch  of M80 Major. This  has  also  increased  the 
company's market share in this segment by seven per cent to  over 
60  per  cent.  There  was also strong  growth  in  the  Japanese 
motorcycle  segment  at  46 per cent led by Boxer  in  the  rural 
segment and Caliber in the urban segment. 

The  company  will  introduce  13 new models  of  two  and  three 
wheelers  in  the  market in a phased manner  over  the  next  24 
months.  The company is setting up a 19.6 MW capacity  wind  mill 
farm  at  Vankusavde, in Satara district. The total cost  of  the 
project is Rs. 95 crores. The power generated by these wind mills 
will be wheeled by MSEB's transmission lines and will be consumed 
by the company's plants at Akurdi, Waluj and Chakan. The  project 
is entitled to various Central and State governments incentives.

For the nine month period ended December 31, 1999, the net profit 
was at Rs. 377.12 crores against a figure of Rs. 340.6 crores  in 
the corresponding period of the previous year. For the nine month 
period  Total sales including other income were at  Rs.  2,967.19 
crores against Rs. 2,707.8 crores.
