Policing towns


Sir,  -  The Defence Minister, Mr. George  Fernandes'  suggestion 
that  policing  functions be brought under the control  of  local 
bodies (The Hindu, Jan. 17) is surprising. Have they acquired the 
required   levels   of   competence   even   to   discharge   the 
responsibilities  assigned  to  them  in  the  areas  of  health, 
elementary education, town planning, roads and parks? The  answer 
is `no'.

Moreover,  in the present political milieu of our  country,  even 
continuous  functioning  of  the local  bodies  without  periodic 
dislocations  is  not guaranteed. So, it is rather  premature  to 
think  of entrusting the administration of a vital department  to 
the local bodies. 

On the other hand, greater control by the Centre over maintenance 
of law and order in States will be desirable in the long-run.
