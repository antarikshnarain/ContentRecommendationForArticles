Govt. ads. a breach of poll code: Cong.


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN. 21. The Congress(I) has  charged  the  Vajpayee 
Government with violating the model code of conduct by  releasing 
large  advertisements on its achievements during the 100 days  in 
office at a time when Assembly elections in four States are round 
the corner.

The  party  has urged the Election Commission to  take  suo  motu 
cognisance of the matter.

Meanwhile, the Congress has delayed announcing its candidates for 
the  first phase of elections in Bihar on February  12,  although 
the Central Election Committee cleared a majority of the nominees 
for  108  seats  late last night. One of  the  reasons  was  that 
releasing  the list would lead to a virtual stampede at the  AICC 
headquarters.

The  CEC  is likely to discuss Bihar again.  Party  sources  said 
Haryana might be taken up by the CEC on Sunday, while the  Orissa 
Pradesh Election Committee would meet in Bhubaneshwar tomorrow to 
scrutinise the applications from ticket-seekers.

On  the  Vajpayee  Government's publicity  blitzkrieg,  Mr.  Anil 
Shastri,  AICC  spokesman,  in  a  press  release,  detailed  the 
``bungling'' of the Government. Terrorism continued unabated  and 
even  security  forces  were being  targeted,  leading  to  their 
demoralisation.  The hijacking of the Indian Airlines  plane  and 
the  release  of the three militants reflected  the  Government's 
failure in the areas of security, foreign policy, civil  aviation 
safety and in the fight against terrorism.
