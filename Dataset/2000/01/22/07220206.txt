Xu Jun, Hoang Thanh Trang crowned champions


By Rakesh Rao

UDAIPUR, JAN. 21. The last round of the Asian chess  championship 
saw the third seeds come first. Xu Jun led a Chinese 1-2-3 in the 
men's  section  before  Vietnam's  Hoang  Thanh  Trang  prevented 
China's twin-success at the CIE Complex here on Friday. 

There  was very little to cheer for the host. After a  close-draw 
with teammate P. Harikrishna, eighth seeded K. Sasikiran finished 
fifth  and  missed a chance to complete a  11-  game  Grandmaster 
norm.  S.  Vijayalakshmi  finished two places  below  her  fourth 
seeding, to just about make the prize-list after signing off with 
a  victory.  Indians  can draw consolation  from  the  fact  that 
Vijayalakshmi made her third WGM norm while Surya Shekhar Ganguly 
and Harikrishna, like Iran's Ghaem Meghami Ehsan, gained IM norms 
from  this continental championship with a prize-fund of  mere  $ 
5,000. 

Though  the  Indians  were never in serious  contention  for  top 
honours in either sections, the title-race was far more  fiercely 
fought in the women's category.

Hoang,  who won the 1998 World junior girls title  at  Kozhikode, 
needed  to  win the final round against WIM-norm  aspirant  Tania 
Sachdev  on the top board. Hoang could not afford to agree for  a 
draw  with Tania since a possible tie for the top place with  Qin 
Kanying would have cost her the title. Since all the players  had 
agreed  to  break  any tie by taking the  average-rating  of  the 
opponents  involved  in  a tie,  the  calculations  favoured  Qin 
Kanying. 

So,  Hoang had no choice but to play for a win, more so after  it 
became  clear that Qin Kanying was well on her way to  beat  Rani 
Hamid on the second board. Beginning the day half-a- point behind 
Hoang,  Qin Kanying notched an easy victory and waited for  Tania 
to deny Hoang a victory. 

Tania, needing a draw to gain her first WIM norm, played a little 
too defensively in the early part after adopting the Kings Indian 
Defence.  But  slowly Tania gained in strength and  even  won  an 
exchange  in  the  complex middle-game.  However,  the  sustained 
pressure  saw  Tania  blunder her way to an  ending  where  Hoang 
enjoyed a two-pawn advantage with both players having only a rook 
each. 

After 88 moves, spread over just under seven hours, Tania gave up 
and  a  much-relieved  Hoang  became the  new  Asian  queen.  The 
20-year-old Hoang, with nine points, received $ 600 and  Kanying, 
$ 400. 

The  28-year-old men's champion Xu Jun defeated  fellow-GM  Uzbek  
Saydalli  Yuldashev in just 28 moves on the second  board  before 
the other overnight leader and top seed, Peng Xiaomin was held by 
teammate Wang Zili, also in 28 moves on the top board.

Xu  Jun who notched 8.5 points took the first prize of $ 1,100. 
Zhang Zhong and Peng Xiaomin tied for the second spot with  eight 
points each. When the tie was broken by taking the average-rating 
of  opponents of both players, Zhang Zhong's tally stood at  2498 
as against Peng Xiaomin's 2489.
