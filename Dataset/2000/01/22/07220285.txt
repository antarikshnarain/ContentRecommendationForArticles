Thumping win for Bangladesh 


By Sanjay Rajan

COLOMBO, JAN. 21. Zimbabwe and Bangladesh from Group I and  South 
Africa and Ireland from Group II made it to the semifinals in the 
Plate  Championship for the lower eight teams in the Youth  World 
Cup  here.  All  the four teams recorded  their  second  straight 
victories here on Friday.

Of the four contests all eyes were on the Bangladesh- Kenya clash 
at Matara. With Zimbabwe certain to qualify from that group,  the 
encounter  between these two teams, both countries  with  one-day 
status,  would have decided as to which would make the  last-four 
stage.

Bangladesh,  opting  to bat, made 198 with  useful  contributions 
coming  from  Md.  Kalim (28) and Kuntal  Chanda  (23).  Left-arm 
spinner Md. Sheikh took four wickets for Kenya.

In  reply, Kenya was bundled out 73. A. Hossain (three  for  21), 
Hannan  Sarker  (two for 17) and Mossadek Hossain (two  for  six) 
were the main wicket-takers for Bangladesh.

Namibia put on a good fight against Zimbabwe in Galle while South 
Africa  put it across Holland with ease at the Asgiriya  Stadium. 
In Radella, Ireland defeated Americas by 85 runs.

The  third  and final round of the Super-Eights matches  will  be 
played  on Saturday. The much-anticipated India-Sri  Lanka  clash 
will decide the Group II topper.
