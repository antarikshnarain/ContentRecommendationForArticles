Left Front sans CPI(M) readying for battle


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI, JAN. 21. Constituents of the ``third'' Front,  formed 
by  the non-CPI(M) Left parties and the Samajwadi Party  for  the 
Bihar  Assembly elections, have reached an agreement on  most  of 
the  324 seats they plan to contest but it would take them a  few 
days to finalise the arrangement.

Sources in the ``front'' attributed the delay to the  overlapping 
claims  by the CPI and CPI(M-L) on about 25 seats, and  the  SP's 
demand   for   more  than  50  seats  which  others   regard   as 
``disproportionate'' to its presence in the State. But they  were 
confident the difficulties would be sorted by early next week.

The   CPI,  the  largest  Front  constituent,  said  today   that 
negotiations  with  the  CPI(M-L) and the SP were  in  the  final 
stages  and  there  was no reason to  be  pessimistic  about  the 
outcome.  ``In fact we have already arrived at a broad  agreement 
but  since we are keen to project a united face we don't want  to 
leave anything to chance,'' the CPI national secretary, Mr.  Atul 
Anjan, said.

According to the tentative agreement, there is no dispute between 
the CPI and the CPI(M-L) on 238 seats with 154 seats going to the 
CPI and 84 to the CPI(M-L). The ``quarrel''is over 25 seats which 
both  parties  claim should go to them, and though at  one  stage 
they  seemed  resigned to ``friendly'' contests there is  now  an 
attempt  to  avoid them. Both parties emphasised that  they  were 
keen  on  narrowing  the  differences as  far  as  possible,  and 
eventually  they might agree to split the 25 seats  between  them 
instead on insisting on claiming all of them.
