Kasparov outwits Morozevich


By Arvind Aaron 

WIJK AAN ZEE, JAN. 21. World No. 1 Garry Kasparov humbled Russian 
teammate Alexander Morozevich in a fifth round encounter to  stay 
in  joint  lead at the De Moriaan here on  Thursday.  Viswanathan 
Anand,  ranked second in the world, was held to a draw  by  Judit 
Polgar of Hungary and has three points from five games. 

Kasparov  was  joined by Vladimir Kramnik at the  top  with  four 
points  from  five  games. Friday is the  second  free  day.  The 
category-18 event will resume with the sixth round on Saturday.

The  Kasparov-Morozevich duel was the hottest on a day which  saw 
Kasparov  in  command. He prevailed in 45 moves  with  the  white 
pieces  against Morozevich's Slav defence. Opting for  a  typical 
gambit  line, Morozevich found his strategy not  working  against 
the  best  player  in the world. Kasparov  remained  in  control, 
playing faster than normal and not encountering time trouble.  He 
won a pawn on the 24th move and entered a minor piece ending with 
an  advantage. Morozevich surrendered when he had to give up  his 
knight to contain white's advancing pawn. 

Judit  halted  her two-loss streak by holding Anand in  27  moves 
with  the white pieces. Anand played the Sicilian  defence  while 
Judit  opted  for the Rauser attack. In  a  different  variation, 
white's  timing to open the centre was dubious and Anand  had  no 
problems in equalising. He Anand defended securely to repeat  the 
position for a draw which took under an hour. 

The results (fifth round): 

P.  Nikolic (Bih) bt J. Piket (Ned); P. Leko (Hun) drew  with  J. 
Timman (Ned); V. Kramnik (Rus) bt S. Lputian (Arm); Judit  Polgar 
(Hun)  drew with V. Anand (Ind); V. Korchnoi (Swi) drew  with  N. 
Short  (Eng);  G. Kasparov (Rus) bt A. Morozevich (Rus);  L.  van 
Wely (Ned) lost to M. Adams (Eng).
