Board dumps request for replacement


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN 21. The Indian team management in  Australia  is 
learnt  to  have  asked for a replacement for  the  injured  Ajit 
Agarkar but the request was shot down by the Board.

With the injury-prone Agarkar sidelined, the team management  had 
specifically pleaded for Tamil Nadu seamer T. Kumaran to be flown 
to  Australia to boost the stingless attack. It was a  remarkable 
turnaround after Kumaran had been sent back once the Test  series 
was over despite some encouraging bowling in the tour matches.

The lack of faith in Debasis Mohanty was quite evident from  this 
request  but  the  National selectors were  not  inclined  to  be 
dictated by the team management on this occasion.

It is learnt that Anil Kumble, Devang Gandhi and Venkatesh Prasad 
stayed on for the one-day series only at the instance of the team 
management  which  emphasised  on experience. V.  V.  S.  Laxman, 
originally  slated to return after the Tests, had also  continued 
with  the tour party at the instance of the team management.  The 
selectors,  unhappy  at the treatment meted out  to  Kumaran  and 
Harbhajan  Singh,  were said to be of the opinion that  the  team 
management  needed to give a break to someone like  Mohanty,  who 
had been reduced to a `nets' bowler.

In  the  process, Kumaran, who earned lavish  praise  from  coach 
Kapil  Dev, missed out on the opportunity to play in the  one-day 
series  after  having  excelled in  the  one-dayers  against  New 
Zealand  at  home  and  during the tour  games  on  the  tour  of 
Australia.
