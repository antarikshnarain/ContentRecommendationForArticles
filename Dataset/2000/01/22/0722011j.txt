Susmita jumps to National record 


By Our Special Correspondent

SALEM, JAN. 21 The under-16 athletes seem to have plenty to offer 
in  terms of records. On the third day too, Susmita Singharoy  of 
Bengal bettered her own National mark in the girls under-16  high 
jump  this  morning,  but  by the  time  the  relay  events  were 
completed  her State suffered a jolt because of  disqualification 
in  the  4 X 100 m under-16 event of the  Vinayaka  Mission  15th 
junior National athletics meet at the Mahatma Gandhi Stadium here 
today.

Bengal  lost  a silver because of this  punishment.  Perhaps  for 
overstepping  the zone during baton exchange. But this  benefited 
Maharashtra, which collected the silver, and Tamil Nadu bronze.

Susmita  has been in the forefront in high jump and she and  Lucy 
Desmukh  of Bengal have been battling it out. They have  together 
jointly hold the National record of 1.61 m. Susmita won the  gold 
last  year  too and this time she was well  challenged  by  Tamil 
Nadu's  M. Sangeetha. Actually, they tied at 1.64 m, but  Susmita 
had cleared that height in her first attempt itself and Sangeetha 
in the third attempt. 

There were three more meet marks also. Veteran and popular  coach 
Nambiar's  trainee  R. Sukumari is in a splendid form  here.  She 
took the gold in under-20 400 m with a new meet record of  55.95, 
bettering Vanaja's 56.1 s, set in 1996.

Kalpana Das gave Bengal a golden start with a meet record win  in 
the  triple  jump,  clearing 12.40 m.  She  improved  upon  Reena 
Thomas's  12.24  m,  set  in  '99  at  Cuttack.  H.M.  Jyothi  of 
Karnataka, another talented under-16 girl, ran an excellent  race 
in the 400 m, clocking 57.99 s. This erased Sutappa Das's mark of 
58.40 s, set in 1998 at Ernakulam.
