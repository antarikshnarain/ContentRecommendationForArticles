A blinkered panel


Sir, - The Subrahmanyam Committee on Kargil was chartered only to 
point out what went wrong, and not to identify who went wrong and 
why.  Even  a  child  knows that the root  cause  of  the  Kargil 
intrusions  was the total failure of our intelligence system.  It 
does not require a 200-page report to say so. 

What  the  nation wants to know is what were the  lapses  in  the 
existing system and who was responsible for them - both questions 
outside the committee's charter.

After  the U.K.'s Falkland conflict and Israel's Yom Kippur  war, 
enquiries  were  held  to  go into  the  lapses.  In  Britain,  a 
committee  even blamed the Margaret Thatcher Cabinet for  certain 
avoidable casualties.

In  the latter case, the Israeli Director of Military  Operations 
(who  was  to take over from Moshe Dayan as the next  chief)  was 
dismissed for just a two-day delay in acting on the  intelligence 
of the Egyptian army which was passed on to him.

Since political or bureaucratic accountability has never been  an 
integral part of our governance, no politician or bureaucrat  was  

held  responsible for the 1962 Chinese debacle or any  lapses  in 
the three wars with Pakistan or the Sri Lanka fiasco. 

So  also now, no heads, not even of the military men,  will  roll 
for what happened in Kargil.
