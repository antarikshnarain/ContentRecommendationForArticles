dated January 22, 1950: Scientists' role in India


Mr. Rajagopalachari, who was welcoming the guests on the occasion 
of  opening ceremony of the National Physical Laboratory, in  New 
Delhi,  on  January 21, said that those who sought  to  obtain  a 
deeper  knowledge of physical science automatically developed  an 
attitude of reverence towards the mystery of the universe,  which 
was the essence of religion.

On  the  role of scientists and the necessity to spend  money  on 
research, Mr. C. Rajagopalachari observed: ``If the scientists of 
India  make up their minds they can raise India's prestige  to  a 
degree which will more than make up for any failure of defects in 
other fields.

``There  are  people  who would say, why waste  money  on  costly 
adventures in science or on fine arts or on tombs and temples and 
Churches and festivals, when we have so much to do and so  little 
money to spare? Lord Curzon, one of my predecessors, speaking  on 
the  Ancient  Monuments Bill had said: Since I came to  India  we 
have spent upon repairs at AGra alone large sums. Every rupee has 
been  an offering of reverence to the past, a gift  of  recovered 
beauty  to the future; and I do not believe that there is a  tax-
payer  in  this country who will grudge one anna of  the  outlay. 
This is a very fine utterance which we should ponder over.

``There are many things which indirectly help progress and are no 
less important than works of direct utility. Money spent on fairs 
and  festivities, we should know, is money invested for  law  and 
order. Money spent on fundamental research is not money wasted on 
empty  prestige  but  is a good and  necessary  investment  which 
progressive  nations  do  well not to grudge.  When  we  reach  a 
critical point in anything it is only science that can help.''
