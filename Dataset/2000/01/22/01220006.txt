U.P. power strike talks fail


By Our Special Correspondent

LUCKNOW,  JAN.  21. The two-day negotiations  between  the  Uttar 
Pradesh  Government  and the State Electricity  Board  Employees' 
Joint  Action Committee to end the seven-day-old  power  workers' 
strike  ended  here this afternoon without any  breakthrough,  as 
both sides remained adamant.

UNI reports:

The Allahabad High Court has restrained the State Government from 
disturbing  the  privacy of the wives of  striking  employees  by 
their visits to their houses during odd hours in connection  with 
the  arrest  of their husbands. The court passed the order  on  a 
writ petition.
