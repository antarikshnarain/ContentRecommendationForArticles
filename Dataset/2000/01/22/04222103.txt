By Our Staff Correspondent

MYSORE, JAN. 21. Group clashes claimed two lives when a youth was 
hacked  to  death  and  a woman burnt  alive  in  retribution  at 
Gorahalli  village  in Periyapatna taluk last night.  Two  others 
received  severe  injuries in the frenzied violence  between  the 
groups.   The   deceased  were  identified  as  Raja   Naik   and 
Sumangalamma.

An  armed mob of 50 persons stormed into the house of  Chandrappa 
and  set  it on fire at around 9 p.m when  Chandrappa,  his  wife 
Gowramma, and daughters were having dinner. Police said two  tins 
of  kerosene procured from a shop came in handy to the mob  which 
went  berserk.  In the melee, Sarvamangala, who  was  inside  the 
house, was charred to death and the house reduced to a  shambles. 
The  immediate  cause  for the violence has  been  attributed  to 
retribution  for  the killing of a youth, Raja Naik,  by  a  gang 
owing  allegiance to Chandrappa. Police say  Mallikarjuna  Swamy, 
son of Chandrappa, and a few others picked up a quarrel with Raja 
Naik  last night and the latter was hacked to death. As the  news 
of Raja Naik's murder spread, about 50 persons, owing  allegiance 
to the deceased, targetted Chandrappa and his family.Police  said 
Rama Naik and 17 others were arrested on the basis of a complaint 
filed  by  Chandrappa's wife, and a case of murder,  rioting  and 
dacoity registered against them. Chandrappa's sons,  Mallikarjuna 
Swamy, Yatheesh Kumar and Keerthi Kumar, were taken into  custody 
in  connection with the violence and the alleged murder  of  Raja 
Naik. Cases have also been registered against Chandrappa, who was 
hospitalised with burns.
