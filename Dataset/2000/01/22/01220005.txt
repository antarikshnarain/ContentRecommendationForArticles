Talks on ports strike under way


NEW DELHI, JAN. 21. Breaking a three-day impasse, the  Government 
and  representatives  of the striking port and dock  workers  sat 
down on the negotiating table today for closed-door talks.  After 
preliminary talks this morning, the two sides met again at 4 p.m. 
The  talks  remained  inconclusive  even  after  five  hours   of 
deliberations and were still on when reports last came in.

The  Union  Surface Transport Minister, Mr.  Rajnath  Singh,  the 
Shipping  Secretary, Mr. R Vasudevan, and other senior  officials 
represented the Government, while the federations were led by Dr. 
Shanti   Patel,  president,  All-India  Port  and  Dock   Workers 
Federation, Mumbai.

``I  think we will reach an amicable solution at the  earliest,'' 
Mr.  Rajnath Singh told mediapersons after the talks. When  asked 
if there were any developments, Dr. Patel said, ``I've nothing to 
tell you at this moment. The talks are continuing.''

Earlier,  Dr.  Patel said they had made it clear  that  the  port 
trust should not be treated as a Public Sector Undertaking  (PSU) 
and that separate guidelines should be applied to it.
