Infotech stocks rally, Sensex up 67 points


MUMBAI, JAN. 21. After initial hesitancy, equities,  particularly 
infotech  stocks, rallied smartly lifting the Sensex by about  67 
points  in lacklustre activity on the Bombay Stock Exchange  here 
today  following  shortcovering  as  well  as  fresh  buying   by 
speculators as well as institutional investors.

Operators  who  had turned cautious and attempted  to  square  up 
positions  at  early stages fearing high badla in line  with  the 
Calcutta Stock Exchange where carry forward charges were fixed at 
35 per cent.

However,  sizable purchases by foreign funds in  software  sector 
coupled with flow of excellent corporate news induced speculators 
to create fresh positions in select fundamentally strong counters 
aiding the benchmark to recover part of its overnight losses.

The BSE sensitive index opened steady at 5352.63 and later dipped 
to the day's low of 5330.08 before recovering to 5423.05 at close 
against  yesterday's  close of 5355.80, netting a rise  of  67.25 
points  or 1.26 per cent. The BSE-100 index rose by 54.41  points 
to 2837.21 from 2782.80.

The  FIIs  were  reportedly  net buyers in  key  shares  such  as 
Infosys,  SSI,  Silverline,  Sun  Pharma,  Dabur  India,   Satyam 
Computer, Wipro, ITC, Reliance and Zee Telefilms.

Domestic  institutions  too picked up shares  of  private  sector 
banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and others. Sources said  the 
market was still bullish and anticipated a strong rally ahead  of 
presentation  of the union budget in the latter part of the  next 
month.

In the specified group, ten scrips hit the upper price band after 
exhausting the daily price limit. Of the 139 specified shares, 57 
registered  sharp  to moderate gains while 75 showed  losses  and
