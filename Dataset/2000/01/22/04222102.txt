MANGALORE,  JAN. 21. Five schoolgirls and a 45-year-old man  died 
when  a  boat capsized at Pilikula Nisarga Dhama  Boating  Centre 
here  today. At least 22 other children, travelling in the  boat, 
were rescued and were said to be out of danger.

The  names  of the dead were given as  Sushma,  Anusha,  Ashwini, 
Raveena  Vaz and Prajna Attavar, all of them class VIII  students 
of St. Ann's School. The name of the dead man was given as Suresh 
Shetty. 

According  to police, the accident occurred at about 11 a.m.  due 
to  overloading of the only motor boat available at  the  tourist 
spot. The boat was designed to carry two adults and six children.

According  to  eyewitnesses, some youth, who were on  the  shore, 
jumped into the water and rescued the children. 

The  district administration has pressed the Coast  Guard  divers 
into service and special lights have been arranged at the spot as 
darkness set in. 

Parents and relatives of the children, helped the police and  the 
Fire Brigade officials in rescue operations. But when the parents 
found  that there was no life saving material at the  lake,  they 
took the park officials to task and damaged a few lamp posts. 

Mr.  Kamal Panth, Superintendent of Police, Mr. J.R.Lobo,  former 
Executive  Director  of  the Pilikula Nisarga  Dhama,  and  other 
officials,  pacified the parents and relatives. It is  said  that 
when  the boat capsized, there was no one to rescue the  children 
nor  were  there any life jackets. The boat driver, it  is  said, 
instead  of  helping  the children, escaped  into  the  adjoining 
forests. 

The Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Kapil Mohan, has 
ordered a judicial inquiry into the accident. 

Rescue  operations in progress at Pilikula Nisarga Dhama  Boating 
Centre in Mangalore on Friday.
