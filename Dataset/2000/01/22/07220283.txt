Razzaq dazzles and rattles 


By G. Viswanath

HOBART,  JAN. 21. The Indians are now in the proverbial `jaws  of 
death' in the Australian summer's showpiece event, the Carlton  & 
United tri- series, which they get to play once in a decade. They 
were `Razzaqed' at the Bellerive Oval on Friday eventhough  their 
captain  Sachin  Tendulkar made a manly attempt  to  salvage  the 
first points for his side in the match against Pakistan. 

The strong foundation that he and his deputy, Sourav Ganguly laid 
was  evident  in the best opening stand of the series -  a  stand 
which was one short of a hundred runs.

The  20-year-old seamer, Abdur Razzaq kept hammering on that  all 
the  time and dismantled it brick by brick to leave  the  Indians 
short of the high target by 32 runs. The fourth defeat in a row - 
two  each against Australia and Pakistan - has not only seen  the 
host  and  its Asian neighbour advance towards the final  of  the 
tri-series, but has also made the Australian tour the worst  ever 
for an Indian team.

Razzaq  is not a `jack of all trades', who bats and bowls  a  bit 
and  listens avidly to his master, but is a  quintessential  all-
rounder. Though his first name and surname was mis-spelt so often 
-  Abdur  appearing as Abdul and Razzaq as Rassak and  took  some 
time  for  the correction and clarification to be made -  he  was 
always a dangerous customer to his rivals. 

The Indians discovered his true potential on Friday when he first 
flogged  the  bowlers  to  make  a  career-high  score  and  then 
dismissed five Indian batsmen which included the prized scalps of 
Tendulkar and Ganguly. 

The  Indian captain was stunned by a delivery, which  moved  just 
off  the pitch, beat his defence and came to hit the top  of  the 
off  stump.  ``I did not sight the ball. I asked Robin  Singh  to 
watch his first ball,'' said Tendulkar at the press conference.

Tendulkar takes control

Tendulkar was determined to prevent the Indian ship from sinking. 
Between  him and Ganguly there were a number of  clean,  cracking 
shots that reached the advertising boards. Tendulkar's shots  had 
the  ferocity  of  a  rocket  while  Ganguly's  drives  had   the 
characteristic flair and hip. 

Ganguly's  backfoot drives showed the first signs  of  aggression 
before Tendulkar raced past the left-hander by taking three fours 
in an over from Shoaib Akhtar. As is always, Tendulkar's straight 
drive, pull and extra-cover had his distinctive stamp.

The  Pakistanis  endured the punishment from the  Indian  openers 
before Akram replaced himself with Razzaq. The lithe seamer, with 
a  prominent jaw-cut face, separated the pair whose  riposte  for 
one and half hours had forced Pakistan to concede much ground. 

Ganguly's  pleasing knock ended softly - a leading edge going  to 
Shahid Afridi placed in a catching position at cover. Venkat  Sai 
Laxman, who was prepared to repeat the blows he had dealt on  the 
Australian  bowlers in the Sydney Test, saw a Razzaq delivery  go 
off the face of the bat to Moin Khan.

Tendulkar  who  had fallen cheaply and made only 24 runs  in  the 
previous three innings was determined to make sure that  Pakistan 
did not run away with the match. The fourth-wicket stand  between 
him and Rahul Dravid appeared to have stalled Pakistan's progress 
when  Akram won a leg before decision from umpire  Daryl  Harper. 
Dravid's dismissal was a big blow. 

Tendulkar's  half-century  was almost a par effort  in  terms  of 
balls  faced  and what happened a little later turned  out  to  a 
bigger blow. 

The  Pakistan  captain's decision to call Razzaq for  his  second 
tilt spelt doom for India, whose run rate was superior to that of 
Pakistan  around the 36th over. Tendulkar had played  a  delicate 
late cut off Afridi and driven him to the cover fence and  looked 
set to take India to its first win. 

But  Razzaq,  as instructed by Akram, bowled an  outswinger.  ``I 
told  him to deliver the ball from over the middle stump,''  said 
Akram.  Razzaq had knocked back Tendulkar's middle stump  at  the 
Gabba  and  on Friday it was the off-stump. Tendulkar  failed  to 
convert  his sixth half-century in the last three  years  against 
Pakistan  into  a  century and  a  match-winning  effort.  Razzaq 
finished with a five-wicket haul, though not his best because  he 
gave  away 17 runs more than his five for 31 against Zimbabwe  in 
October last year.

``I  think the Indian team is too much dependent on one  batsman. 
He  (Tendulkar)  has  been under tremendous  pressure.  What  the 
Indians need is another good batsman in form and an all- rounder. 
Razzaq  has always been a match winner for us. At his age  I  can 
say he appears to be better than what I was. He is a very  mature 
cricketer doing the right things. What he has to do now is  train 
and keep himself fit so that he can play for Pakistan for ten  to 
12 years,'' said Akram.

Earlier, Tendulkar had invited Pakistan to bat because there  was 
moisture  underneath  the surface and there was a  likelihood  of 
showers  in the afternoon. The Indian fielding was not on  par  - 
Laxman  putting down a chance at second slip and Debasis  Mohanty 
himself  failing  to control a return catch  after  getting  both 
hands  to  the ball. These lapses did not prove  dear  as  Sameer 
Dighe, standing up to the stumps to Ganguly, first brought off  a 
superb  leg side catch to send back Saeed Anwar and then  took  a  
fine  catch  to  remove  Inzamam-ul-Haq.  Ijaz  Ahmed's  cautious 
approach fetched him a half- century, Yousuf Youhana  contributed 
a useful 45 and when it appeared that the Indians would keep  the 
Pakistan  score  to  below 250, Razzaq  played  an  innings  that 
captains  dream  of. He made 70 off 50 balls which  saw  Pakistan 
raise 91 runs in the last ten overs and set a target of 263.  The 
Indians'  slow over-rate cost them two overs but that really  was 
not  the  reason for their fourth defeat. The  reason  was  Abdur 
Razzaq.
