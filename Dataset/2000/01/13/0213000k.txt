A sell-out to U.S., says Left


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. The Left Parties have said the Government has 
compromised  with the national interest in signing  an  agreement 
with  the  United States to phase out  quantitative  restrictions 
(QRs)  on  imports  by April 2001. While  India's  other  trading 
partners such as the European Union, Japan, Australia and  Canada 
had agreed to remove the restrictions by 2003, the U.S. succeeded 
in getting the Vajpayee Government to remove all restrictions  on 
imports two years earlier, the CPI(M) pointed out.

The  agreement  would have an adverse effect  on  Indian  farmers 
because agricultural commodities, along with all consumer  items, 
could now be freely imported without restrictions. By agreeing to 
remove  all restrictions, the reservation policy for  the  small-
scale units would become inoperable. In effect, this amounted  to 
dereservation, it said.

The  CPI  accused  the  BJP-led  NDA  Government  of  not  taking 
Parliament into confidence which amounted to ``sell-out'' of  the 
national interests. It called upon the political parties and mass 
organisations to protest and resist these moves. While on the one 
hand,  Central  Ministers, notably the  Commerce  Minister,  made 
noises  about being custodians of the national interest,  on  the 
other,  they quietly acquiesced in whatever was dictated  by  the 
WTO and the U.S.
