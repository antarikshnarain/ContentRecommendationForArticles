Two arrested for possessing Masood's speech


DHARAMSALA, JAN. 12. Police have arrested two persons from Bihar, 
including  a  cleric  of  a  mosque  in  Himachal  Pradesh,   for 
possessing audio cassettes containing speeches by Maulana  Masood 
Azhar,  one  of  the  three militants freed  in  return  for  the 
hostages of the hijacked Indian Airlines plane.

Maulvi Mohammad Oyesi Ahmed, a cleric in a mosque near  Palampur, 
and Zahir, a labourer, were arrested yesterday. Cassettes  titled 
``Jehad''  and  ``Babri  Masjid Ki Pukar''  were  recovered  from 
Zahir.  He  led the police to Maulvi Mohammad Oyesi  Ahmed  of  a 
mosque at Yol cantonment, 10 km from Palampur.

The  Maulvi  and  Zahir belong to Bhagalpur  and  Goda  districts 
respectively.  A  case  under  the Indian  Penal  Code  has  been 
registered  against the two for ``sedition and attempt to  create 
disharmony among communities''.

A  high-level  central intelligence team was expected  to  arrive 
here  soon  to interrogate the two, sources said. It  would  also 
assess  the  extent to which terrorist activities had  spread  in 
Himachal Pradesh, especially in the Kangra district.
