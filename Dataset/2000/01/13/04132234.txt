'AIADMK will consult friendly parties'


By Our Special Correspondent

CHENNAI,  JAN. 12. The AIADMK will decide on entering into  fresh 
political  alliances  for  the  Assembly  by-elections  only   in 
consultation  with  ``friendly  parties'',  the  AIADMK   General 
Secretary, Ms. Jayalalitha, said today.

Talking to reporters at the airport on her return from Hyderabad, 
Ms. Jayalalitha declined to reveal the party's electoral strategy 
for the by-elections.

Asked  if the AIADMK was worried about the delay on the  part  of 
the  TMC  and the Congress(I) in bringing  down  the  Pondicherry 
Government, she said her party was not in any hurry for a  change 
of  government  in  the  Union Territory.  Election  was  due  in 
Pondicherry at the same time as in Tamil Nadu, she pointed out.

Reacting  to  the hijacking, she said India's image had  taken  a 
beating. The government had mishandled the crisis, she said.
