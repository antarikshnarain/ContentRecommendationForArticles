Bajaj Auto unveils future plans


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. Bajaj Auto today announced an ambitious  two-
year  programme  during which it will launch 13 variants  of  its 
existing  products in order to beat the downturn in  the  scooter 
market  which  appears to becoming a  permanent  phenomenon.  The 
maximum number of new products will be in the motorcycle segement 
where the company will face competition from LML, its traditional 
rival  in the scooter segment. LML recently decided to go in  for 
the manufacture of motorcycles as the slide in scooter sales does 
not show any sign of abating.

According to the Bajaj Auto Vice-President, Mr. Rajiv Bajaj, this 
is the first time that any company is unveiling so many models in 
each  segment of two wheelers. In addition to five models in  the 
motorcycle  segment,  the  company will  also  launch  three  new 
scooter models beginning from the first half of fiscal 2000-01, a 
scooterette  and a `step-through' each and three  three-wheelers. 
``Bajaj  Auto plans to cement its position as the most  versatile 
and  largest  two-wheeler  manufacturer in  the  country  with  a 
vehicle  for every member of the family at every  price  point,'' 
stressed Mr. Bajaj.In the scooter segment, Mr. Bajaj has lined up 
three  new offerings: Chetak four-stroke, Fusion and Cagiva  CRX. 
While  the  Fusion is a four-stroke 145 cc scooter,  Chetak,  the 
world's largest selling scooter brand, has also been given  four-
stroke engine. The third new offering, Cagiva CRX has been styled 
by the well-known Italian company by the same name.

Of the five motorcycles, Pulsar has been designed by Tokyo R  and 
D  of  Japan and is slated to hit the Indian roads  in  September 
this year.
