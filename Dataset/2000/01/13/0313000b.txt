Merger may cause Gates worry


SEATTLE,  JAN.  12.  It  is not  as  though  the  America  Online 
chairman, Mr. Steve Case and the Microsoft Corporation  chairman, 
Mr. Bill Gates are best friends - far from it.

They have competed in Online services, web browsing software  and 
instant messaging. Now, they and their partners could go head-to-
head  in  high-speed cable Internet access as  well.  Last  year, 
Microsoft  poured  $5  billion  into  AT&T;  Corporation  and   an 
additional  $3  billion in other Telecom companies as part  of  a 
broad strategy to invest in high-speed Internet access.

It  seemed Microsoft was positioned perfectly to  offer  software 
and Internet content over cable Internet hookups - until  Monday, 
when  AOL  announced  its merger with Time  Warner,  the  second-
largest cable provider in the United States. Once again, AOl  and 
Microsoft - via their partners - could be in competition in a new 
area  of  technology,  the  next  generation  of  high-speed,  or 
broadband, Internet services.

``This deal will certainly give Microsoft some pause,'' said  Mr. 
Andrew   Bartells,   senior  research  analyst  with   the   Giga 
information  group. ``Microsoft may have been thinking  that  AOL 
was  being slow with regard to broadband, but AOL just caught  up 
in a hurry.''
