Fiat launches cheaper version of Siena


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. Fiat India Automobiles today announced  plans 
to launch two new vehicles from its platform of ``178 world car'' 
range  as  well as unveil a number of variants  of  its  existing 
models. The company launched a stripped down version of its Siena 
which  will cost Rs. 63,000 less (ex-factory) than  the  existing 
upmarket model.

Speaking  to  newsmen at the Auto Expo here  today,  senior  Fiat 
officials  said the much delayed mid-size car, the  Palio  should 
make an appearance on the Indian roads by this year end. 

The  company's Managing Director, Mr. G. Ravina, said,  ``We  are 
confident of growth in the Indian market and would be positioning 
our  vehicles  in all segments. A new segment is  always  created 
when  a vehicle is introduced and that opens up avenues for  more 
variants.''

The  Palio's  launch  will  be preceded  by  the  Siena  Weekend, 
described  by  officials as the  first  state-of-the-art  station 
wagon  to  hit Indian roads. The launch is billed  for  March  or 
April  and  petrol as well as diesel versions will be  on  offer. 
``The  designing  is contemporary and the station wagon  will  be 
fitted with multi point fuel injection system,'' said officials.

In  between, the company will be unveiling CNG versions of  Siena 
and  Uno to complement the petrol and diesel versions of the  two 
cars from the Fiat stable to hit Indian roads.

The  company's Ranjangaon plant was expected to be ready  by  the 
month end and the company planned to manufacture CNG kits for its 
environment friendly versions at that plant, said officials.
