Russian Dy. PM arriving today


By  Vladimir Radyuhin MOSCOW, JAN. 12. The Deputy Prime  Minister 
of  Russia, Mr. Viktor Khristenko, is arriving in India  tomorrow 
for high-level talks on bilateral cooperation.

Mr.  Khristenko,  who  is the co-chairman of  the  Indo-  Russian 
Intergovernmental   Commission   (IGC)   for   trade,   economic, 
scientific  and  cultural  cooperation, is  leading  a  70-member 
strong delegation for a two-day plenary session of the IGC,  held 
alternatively in Delhi and Moscow every year.

The  visit  carries added significance as it is the  first  high-
level contact between the two countries since the Russian leader, 
Mr.  Boris Yeltsin, resigned and appointed his chosen  successor, 
the Prime Minister, Mr. Vladimir Putin, as Acting President. With 
Mr.  Putin  strongly favoured to win the  presidential  elections 
scheduled  for March 26, Mr. Khristenko's visit offers  India  an 
early  opportunity  to  probe the foreign  policy  priorities  of 
Russia's new leadership.

Set  against this background, the 6th IGC session may be  also  a 
good  occasion to take stock of the Indo-Russian  commercial  and 
economic  cooperation  during Mr. Yeltsin's eight- year  rule  of 
post-Soviet Russia.

Relations  between  India and Russia have seen a  widening  rift, 
after  the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991,  between 
growing political and defence ties on the one hand, and declining 
trade and economic links on the other.
