dated January 13, 1950: Anglo-American recognition


Commenting  on  the  discussions that had been going  on  at  the 
Commonwealth  Foreign  Ministers, at Colombo,  TheHindu  observed 
editorially: ``If recognition of Bao Dai is to be followed up  by 
military  and  economic  help to the  French  in  the  operations 
against  Ho  Chi  Minh  and  his  supporters,  the   Commonwealth 
countries as well as the United States would do well to  consider 
how such action will be viewed by the people's of Asia.

``France's  Far-Eastern colony has been a seething  cauldron  for 
over three years and it is too much to hope that the installation 
of  Bao Dai will help to bring peace to that harassed  land.  The 
French have claimed that by their action on December 30 they have 
granted  Viet  Nam  ``complete  independence  within  the  French 
Union''  and  a  French  Minister  asserted  in  Paris  that  the 
Government  are ready to withdraw French troops if the  Viet  Nam 
Government asks for it. In the same breath he went on to add that 
the  pulling  out of French troops would plunge  the  country  in 
disorder... 

``...  It is clear that the French are anxious to  secure  Anglo-
American recognition for Bao Dai so as to pass on to Britain  and 
U.S. the intolerable burden they have been carrying on during the 
past  three years... India obviously cannot look at  the  problem 
purely  in  terms of the Anglo-American  strategy  of  containing 
Communism  in Asia. She has never sympathised with French  policy 
in  Indo-China  and  cannot support a  move  which  whatever  its 
ostensible anti-Communist motive, gives a fresh lease of life  to 
French imperialism in Asia.
