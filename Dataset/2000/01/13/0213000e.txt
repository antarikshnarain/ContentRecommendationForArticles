H.C refuses to stay order on IGNCA 


By Our Staff Reporter

NEW  DELHI, JAN. 12. The Delhi High Court today refused to  grant 
an   ``ex-parte''   stay   on  the   Union   Government's   order 
reconstituting  the  Indira  Gandhi  National  Centre  for   Arts 
(IGNCA).

 Rejecting  the plea for the relief, Mr. Justice J.B. Goel  said, 
``Taking  into consideration the circumstances and the fact  that 
the  Member-Secretary  has  already  taken  over  the  charge  in 
pursuance of the Government notification of January 8, ex-  parte 
injunction is declined.''

 The Trust through its outgoing Member-Secretary, Mr. M.C. Joshi, 
had  sought an ex-parte injunction pleading with the  Court  that 
the  reconstituted  trust  be  directed  not  to  ``precipitate'' 
matters  as the new Member-Secretary, Mr. N.R. Shetty, had  taken 
over charge and asked the bank to freeze the trust's account.

 The  main question before the Court was whether  the  amendments 
made  on  May  18,  1995, were done  with  the  approval  of  the 
Government.  The Solicitor-General strongly contended that  there 
was no valid approval of the Government 

 In  view  of  the pleas and objections  raised  and  the  public 
interest involved, the Court would later take up for hearing  the 
application for an interim injunction with the  Solicitor-General 
agreeing to file a reply to the prayer within two days, the order 
said.
