Investment Trust board recast


By Our Special Correspondent

CHENNAI,  JAN.  12. A new five-member board headed by Mr.  N.  C. 
Singhal,  former  Vice-Chairman and Managing Director  of  SICCI, 
today assumed charge at the city-based Investment Trust of  India 
(ITI), formalising the change in the management.

The  other members of the new board are Mr. A. L.  Mudaliar,  Mr. 
Sanjay Maloo, Mr. P.L. Maloo and Mr. P.S. Balasubramaniam.

The  new management - Calcutta-based TCK Finance &  Leasing  Pvt. 
Ltd.  -  has sought to provide some continuity by  retaining  Mr. 
Mudaliar as director from among the erstwhile eight-member board. 
The  erstwhile board comprised Mr. B.H. Kothari,  Mr.Charat  Ram, 
Mr. G.K. Sundaram, Mr. G. Chidambar, Mr. Mudaliar, Mr. M.R. Shah, 
Mr. C. Srinivasan and Mr. Ram Ganapati.

Mr. Balasubramaniam, who was hitherto the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO)  and  Company Secretary, is re-designated as  the  Managing 
Director  of the company and is inducted into the board  for  the 
first time. The continued presence of Mr. Balasubramaniam who has 
been  with  ITI  since  1972 is expected to  go  a  long  way  in 
reassuring the depositors and the staff alike. 

The  new look board is a sequel to the sale of 10.67 lakh  equity 
shares  by Mr. B.H. Kothari (who stepped down as Chairman  today) 
and his ilk to the Calcutta outfit. Subsequently, TCK Finance and 
Leasing  acquired another 2.91 lakh shares through open offer  to 
fulfil  the takeover guidelines prescribed by the Securities  and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI). 

The  new promoter was allotted additional 43,58,000 shares  on  a 
preferential   basis   pursuant  to  a   resolution   passed   by 
shareholders  at the extra-ordinary general body meeting  of  the 
company  on October 15, 1999. The Calcutta group  today  controls 
65.58 per cent shares in the enhanced equity capital of Rs.  8.72 
crores.
