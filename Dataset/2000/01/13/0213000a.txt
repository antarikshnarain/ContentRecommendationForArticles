PM cancels trip to Davos summit


By Harish Khare

NEW DELHI, JAN.12. The Prime Minister, Mr. Atal Behari  Vajpayee, 
has  cancelled  his scheduled trip to the  World  Economic  Forum 
meeting at Davos in Switzerland. Every January-end, Davos hosts a 
prestigious  gathering  of government leaders  and  international 
business  captains.  It was to be Mr. Vajpayee's  first  trip  to 
Davos  as  Prime  Minister,  and was  being  looked  upon  as  an 
opportunity to convey to the international business community the 
new  Government's renewed commitment to the  `second  generation' 
economic reforms. 

According to Mr. Brijesh Mishra, principal secretary to the Prime 
Minister,  the  journey to Davos had to be canelled  because  Mr. 
Vajpayee   would  be  necessarily  preoccupied  with  the   Bihar 
elections; the summit will be taking place at a time when the BJP 
would be involved in the selection of candidates for the Assembly 
elections in Bihar, Orissa, Haryana, and Manipur.

 However, industry sources believe that the cancellation reflects 
the  general  mood  of despondency in the  Government  after  the 
surrender at Khandahar. 

The former Prime Minister, Mr. P. V.Narasimha Rao, had  travelled 
twice to Davos as Prime Minister, first in 1992 and then in 1994; 
Mr.  H. D. Deve Gowda, was the only other Prime Minister to  have 
made it to the Davos summit.
