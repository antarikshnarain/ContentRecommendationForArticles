Russians on the defensive


MOSCOW,  JAN.  12. Russian generals were on the  defensive  today 
after  a  series of dramatic raids on Chechen towns  under  their 
control  dealt them the worst setback of their  campaign  against 
Muslim rebels.

Russian television stations broadcast reports late yesterday from 
Shali, a major town in south-east Chechnya which was again  under 
Russian control after a day of fierce fighting.

Russian  troops  had  taken  the town  weeks  ago,  but  Chechens 
attacked  it  and several others simultaneously  on  Sunday,  and 
Russian troops were forced to blast their way back in.

There  were  conflicting  reports about the  situation  in  other 
Russian-held towns that had come under attack, including  Achkhoi 
Martan in the west and Argun and Gudermes in the east.

Russian  military officials said they had restored  control  over 
all  the towns. But their evening status reports said they  fired 
artillery at guerilla targets near Goiti, Argun, Shali and  Urus-
Martan,  scattered  across  the breadth of  the  fertile  Chechen 
heartland they supposedly cleared of rebels weeks ago. A  Chechen 
rebel Internet web site said guerillas had established control of 
some  key  roads and highways, as well as  buildings  in  several 
previously Russian-held towns.

Both  sides also described clashes in and around  Grozny  and  in 
the  southern  mountains, where Russia's military  said  it  also 
carried   out  air  strikes.  Following  the  weekend's   Chechen 
counterattacks,  Russia's top commander in Chechnya,  Mr.  Viktor 
Kazantsev,  said  the  brass had learned  from  its  mistakes.
