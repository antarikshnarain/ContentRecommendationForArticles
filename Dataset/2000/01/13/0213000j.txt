11 detained Israelis released


CALCUTTA, JAN. 12. All the 11 Israeli nationals, detained at  the 
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport here last  night 
due to ``some errors'' in their travel documents and visas,  were 
released tonight for their onward journey to Bangladesh, official 
sources at the airport said.

The passports and intensive interrogation of the detained persons 
revealed  that  they were Israelis and not  Afghans  as  reported 
earlier.  ``Such confirmation was made by the Israeli embassy  in 
Delhi'',  sources  said.  All  of  them  were  on  a  ``religious 
mission'' to Bangladesh. They were allowed to board the Calcutta-
Dhaka flight of the Biman Bangladesh Airlines late tonight.

The  immigration  officials, who earlier  contacted  the  Israeli 
embassy  in  Delhi  to confirm the  identities  of  the  detained 
persons,  said  that they were mostly  Hebrew-speaking  and  this 
caused a delay in the interrogation process.

An  anonymous call to the airport last night, warned of a  hijack 
possibility in a Bangladesh Biman flight.  This strengthened  the 
suspicion  about the Israelis who were  about to board  a  Dhaka-
bound Bangladesh Biman plane.
