Slowdown in industrial production


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN.  12. After a robust increase of  8.7  per  cent 
recorded  in  October 1999, industrial  production  could  hardly 
notch a 3.3 per cent increase in November 1999. Consequently, the 
index  of  industrial production (IIP)  for  April-November  also 
recorded  a lower growth of 6.4 per cent against a 6.9  per  cent 
registered during April-October 1999.

According   to   data  released  by   the   Central   Statistical 
Organisation  (CSO),  the mining sector  registered  zero  growth 
during April-November against a negative 0.8 per cent  registered 
during the same months of 1998. Manufacturing was up 6.9 per cent 
during  April-November against 3.8 per cent in the  corresponding 
period  in the previous year while electricity generation was  up 
7.9  per  cent  during 1999 against 6.2 per  cent  in  1998.  The 
overall  IIP, therefore, registered an increase of 6.4  per  cent 
during  April-November  1999  against 3.6 per cent  in  the  same 
months of 1998.

In  November 1999 alone, the mining sector registered a  negative 
0.8  per cent against a negative 2.6 per cent in  November  1998, 
manufacturing  3.4  per cent against 6 per cent  and  electricity 
generation 7.1 per cent against 6.2 per cent. The overall IIP for 
November  1999 registered an increase of 3.3 per cent  against  a 
5.2 per cent growth registered in November 1998.

Use-based statistics released by the CSO reveal that basic  goods 
production  was up 5.1 per cent during April-November  1999  (1.7 
per  cent),  capital goods was up 7.9 per cent (11.2  per  cent), 
intermediate  goods by 8.9 per cent (5.6 per cent)  and  consumer 
goods  4.9  per cent (1.6 per cent). In  this  segment,  consumer 
durables  production  was  up  11.8 per cent  (4  per  cent)  and 
consumer non-durables by 3.1 per cent (0.9 per cent).

Corresponding  figures  for November 1999 show that  basic  goods 
production was up 3.8 per cent during that month (1.5 per cent in 
November  1998),  capital goods by 3.8 per cent  (13  per  cent), 
intermediate  goods by 0.9 per cent (9.5 per cent)  and  consumer 
goods  by 5.3 per cent (2.9 per cent). In this segment,  consumer 
durables  were up 5.3 per cent (9.9 per cent) and  consumer  non-
durables by 5.3 per cent (1 per cent).

Under  the two-digit industry classification, nine out of the  17 
groups  have  shown  positive  growth  during  November  1999  as 
compared to the production in November 1998. Wool, silk and  man-
made  fibre  textiles have shown the highest growth of  24.3  per 
cent, followed by 11.2 per cent for machinery and equipment other 
than  transport  equipment and 9.6 per cent in  paper  and  paper 
products and printing, publishing and allied industries. 

On the other hand, metal products and parts, except machinery and 
equipment have shown a growth of negative 8.8 per cent,  followed 
by  a  growth  of negative 8.6 per cent  in  other  manufacturing 
industries  and  a  negative 7.7 per  cent  in  rubber,  plastic, 
petroleum and coal products.
