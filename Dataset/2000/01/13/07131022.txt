Welgreen, the lone casualty


By A. Joseph Antony

HYDERABAD, JAN. 12. Of the three seeds left in the fray, Israel's 
Nir   Welgreen   became   Wednesday's  lone   casualty   in   the 
quarterfinals of the ITF Futures tennis tournament at the  Andhra 
Pradesh  Lawn Tennis Assocation Complex, Secunderabad. The  hard-
fought  contest  spanned a minute over an hour and  a  half,  but 
Welgreen gave in to Holland's Sander Groen 3-6, 6-4, 3-6.

For  the  sparse crowd in attendance, there was cause  for  cheer 
when Nitin Kirtane subdued Suwandi Suwandi of Indonesia 7-6, 1-6, 
7-6  as the lone Indian to make the last four stage.  Third  seed 
Ladislav Svarc made short work of India's Vinod Sridhar 6-1, 6-1, 
while Israel's Andy Ram, ranked seventh, overcame Saurav Panja 6-
2, 6-1.

Groen broke Welgreen in the first set's third game, to go 2-1 up. 
Games then went with serve till Groen again broke his opponent in 
the ninth, to take took the set, 6-3. In the second, Groen staved 
off two set points, but lost 4-6. Broken in the decider's opening 
game,  Groen equalised in the third, but clinched the next  three 
to take the set and match.

After  taking  the first set with a 7-1  tie-break  score,  Nitin 
Kirtane lost the next tamely 1-6. With a match-point against  him 
in the 10th game of the third set, Kirtane clawed his way back to 
settle the issue in the tie-break, 8-6.

His  cousin Sandeep went down fighting in the first set  5-7  and 
without  a  whimper  in the second,  1-6.  India's  Vishal  Uppal 
flattered  to  deceive, leading 4-3 in both sets, but  making  no 
headway after that. 

If an early hitch unsettles a player, Saurav Panja was a  victim. 
After  disputing  a  line  call, he  took  a  break  for  medical 
attention,  but could do little against the allround  superiority 
of Andy Ram. 

Be  it a bull-dozing backhand or precise placements,  Ram  called 
the  tune.  He  signed off in style too,  an  ace  leaving  Panja 
without  a  clue  in the concluding game.  A  graduate  in  child 
psychology,  Ram  admitted Panja's injury may have  affected  the 
latter's game. 

For  Ram, its mostly paper work at an Israeli army base near  Tel 
Aviv, where he is putting in a mandatory three year stint. But on 
court here, he was more than a handful for Panja.
