A weighty consideration


Sir,  -  The  recent hijack of the  Indian  Airlines  flight  has 
compelled  me  to write this letter. During my recent  visits  to 
India,  usually disembarking at the Anna  international  airport, 
Chennai,  I  myself have seen security lapses  at  the  departure 
gate. The only concern of the personnel there is to swindle  some 
money from passengers if their handbags are a little heavy.  This 
disgraceful practice has been going on openly for years and it is 
sad the Chennai Airport Authority has still not taken any  action 
to end it.

In November last, during my departure from Chennai for Colombo by 
an IA flight, the security personnel who manned the x-ray machine 
demanded  money, saying my handbag was a little heavy.  I  opened 
the  bag  and  showed it to them. It had only 10  books  which  I 
purchased  during  my visit. I also brought to their  notice  the 
fact  that I had shown the bag to the ticketing officer and  that 
he  allowed it and issued me a tag for it. I refused to  pay  the 
security  personnel and demanded that I be permitted to  see  the 
ticketing  officer again. Then, I was immediately allowed  to  go 
in.

I  took  my  seat and watched these officers.  They  were  openly 
taking  money and putting it into their pockets. More  than  half 
the  passengers travelling by that flight had paid. If the  x-ray 
machine flashes, an officer is supposed to open and examine a bag 
but he is more interested in checking its weight. A Britisher and 
a Swedish national, who were seated next to me and were  watching 
these officers, said: ``Oh God, I don't want to go on this!'' 

Before a major disaster occurs, let the Chennai Airport Authority 
introduce video cameras to monitor these personnel.

T. Anandi,

Colombo
