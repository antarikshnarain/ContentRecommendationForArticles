Rajasthan CPI(M) criticises Election dept. decision


By Our Special Correspondent

JAIPUR,  JAN.  12.  The Rajasthan State unit of  the  CPI(M)  has 
objected  to  the  State Election Department's  decision  to  bar 
persons  against whom criminal cases are pending from  contesting 
the  coming panchayat elections. The party State committee  which 
met  here  during the weekend opposed the bar on those  who  have 
more than two children from entering the electoral fray.

The meeting, by Mr. Sheopath Singh Makkasar, former MP, presiding 
said these decisions could amount to violation of citizen's right 
to  fight elections. In the case of workers of political  parties 
there  could  be  politically motivated cases  against  them  and 
denying the right to contest elections on this ground could  only 
``encourage'' attempts to falsely implicate persons, it felt.

The State unit secretary of the party, Mr. Hariram Chouhan,  said 
there  were separate laws to curb population growth.  Again,  the 
two-child norm for eligibility to contest panchayat elections was 
not  applicable in the Assembly and the Lok Sabha elections.  Mr. 
Chouhan  deplored the decision to increase the  security  deposit 
for candidates and demanded its withdrawal.

The  Committee  decided that the party should  fight  the  coming 
elections on its symbol. The party expressed its solidarity  with 
the striking Rajasthan Government employees and demanded that the 
Government initiate talks to bring about an early settlement.
