Nasdaq joins hands with SSI Technologies


By Our Corporate Reporter

CHENNAI,  JAN.  12. The Nasdaq Stock Market is  forging  a  joint 
venture  company  with  SSI  Technologies,  a  division  of   SSI 
(formerly  Software Solutions Integrated). Announcing  this  here 
today  Mr. Gregor Bailar, CIO and Executive Vice President,  NASD 
(National  Association of Securities Dealers, the parent  company 
of  Nasdaq),  said the new company `IndigoMarkets',  an  offshore 
entity,  would create internet-based trading and  market  systems 
for  Nasdaq  global markets including Nasdaq-Europe  and  Nasdaq-
Japan (which are in the process of being established).

Mr. Bailar said IndigoMarkets' product line would provide  state-
of-the-art  electronic securities market based on  proven  Nasdaq 
market structures. Market facilities would include both order and 
quote  driven structures as well as access to  external  services 
such as third marketing. The company would provide these services 
using the latest distributed and internet technologies  available 
from  several  strategic partners  including  Compaq,  Microsoft, 
Cisco Systems, MCIWorldCom and others. 

Mr. Keshava Shriniwas, Chief Executive Officer, SSI Technologies, 
said  the  new  product line would also  leverage  existing  SSIT 
technology  currently in use in several Asian stock  markets.  He 
said more than 1,800 technical and functional specifications were 
under development for the deployment of Nasdaq-Japan and  testing 
was expected to begin in the third quarter of this year.

Declining  to  go  into the investment details  Mr.  Kalpathi  S. 
Suresh, Chairman and CEO, SSI, merely said this would be a  50:50 
joint venture. He said the structure of the JV and the modalities 
of  funding  would  be worked out soon.  He,  however,  said  the 
initiative  for  the  JV was taken in June  last  year.  He  said 
IndigoMarkets  would  be a technology platform  for  both  Nasdaq 
Europe and Nasdaq Japan.
