Railways defeats Karnataka


By M.C. Raman 

SALEM, JAN. 12. Railways, the former champion, let the  defending 
champion,  Punjab  off the hook yesterday, but  on  Wednesday  it 
combined well to crush Karnataka for its third win at 25-16,  25- 
21, 25-23 in the men's group A of the Senior National  volleyball 
championship at the Bose Maidan here.

At  the adjacent court in a match which was delayed by  the  late 
arrival  of  Punjab and the subsequent drama of the  Andhra  team 
walking  out in a huff after waiting for nearly an  hour,  Punjab 
tightened up it defence to stop its rival at 25-16, 25-21,  25-23 
in another group A match. With its fourth straight win Punjab  is 
not  only  in the knock-out, but also is heading  for  the  group 
honours.

Standard-wise  there was nothing much to write home about.  There 
was  neither prompting from the coaches nor any spirited  display 
by  the  players.  In  fact, the best tie so  far  has  been  the 
Railway-Punjab  encounter  on Tuesday which the  Railways  almost 
won. Today, the Railways was not stretched that far by Karnataka, 
which once again started well and then caved in without any spirt 
left to fight.

Railways  was  in  full flow from the beginning.  More  than  its 
attack, its back-court defence was superb. Even 37-year- old P.V. 
Ramana, who is as fit as a fiddle, retrieved brilliantly,  diving 
and  stretching like an young boy. The team as a  whole  realised 
the  necessity  to win this for finishing at least No. 2  in  the 
group.

Karnataka's block was weak. Even experienced Srishekar hardly did 
anything  to  shore up his team's defence at the net.  No  wonder 
then  that the team lost a 18-17 advantage in the first set  when 
Sudhakar, Sivarajan and Sunil Kumar along with Ramana,  unleashed 
their shots. 

The  early  briskness  that spikers  Damodhar,  Prakash  Rao  and 
Lakshminarayana,  who  was hardly inspiring, displayed  began  to 
wane  soon. After losing the second set tamely, Karnataka  showed 
some improvement in the third in which the team again took a  15- 
13  lead.  But  Railways'  solid  back-court  defence   retrieved 
everything  and launched quick counter attack in one of the  most 
exciting part of the match. 

Andhra  had  neither  the defence nor  the  attack  to  challenge 
Punjab.  It  is a revamped side as only five  players  have  been 
retained  from last year's squad. At no point was  Punjab  really 
stretched. The champion side spiked with devastating effect.  Roy 
Joseph,  the  centre blocker, hit the short  ball  quickly.  Amir 
Singh,  Jagbir Singh and Manoj Kumar kept up the  pressure  right  
through.  With Suraj Prakash setting well, the team never  failed 
to keep up the momentum. 

In  the  third  set, veteran setter Venkatnarayana  came  in  and 
Ravikanth Reddy became a spiker. It was a neck and neck race from 
22-all,  but Punjab's defence helped the team clinch  its  fourth 
victory in the pool.

Shaky start by Kerala

Kerala  made a shaky start against the Services, but  managed  to 
come  back for a 25-27, 25-22, 25-19, 25- 20 victory in group  B. 
This  was  Kerala's third win in four matches and  the  team  has 
qualified for the knock-out.

Tamil Nadu scored its fourth straight win when it outplayed Uttar 
Pradesh at 25-20, 25-20, 25-18 in group B.
