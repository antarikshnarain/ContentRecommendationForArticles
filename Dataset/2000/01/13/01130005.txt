Irked judge transfers Sharif case to junior


By Amit Baruah

ISLAMABAD, JAN. 12. In a dramatic development, the judge  hearing 
the  hijacking case against the ousted Pakistani Prime  Minister, 
Mr.  Nawaz Sharif, announced today in open court in Karachi  that 
he could not hear the matter and transferred it to be heard by  a 
junior colleague.

After  it  was  pointed out to Mr.  Justice  Shabbir  Ahmed  that 
intelligence  agents  were sitting in the court  along  with  the 
accused,  the  presiding judge got angry and  abruptly  announced 
that he would no longer hear the case. ``I cannot provide a  fair 
trial in these circumstances,'' he said.

The judge also ordered that the intelligence agents be  arrested, 
but  a prosecution lawyer was quoted as saying later  in  Karachi 
that no arrests had been made since no ``written order'' had been 
issued.

Mr.  Justice Ahmed also ordered that Mr. Rehmat  Hussain  Jaffry, 
who  was  earlier hearing the case, begin re-hearing  the  matter 
from  Monday.  Earlier, the military Government had  amended  the 
Anti-  Terrorism Act and said the hijacking case would be  placed 
before  a  High Court judge, who would staff  the  special  anti-
terrorist court (ATC).

Following  his appointment, Mr. Justice Ahmed of the  Sindh  High 
Court  began  hearing  the case in his  capacity  as  ATC  judge. 
However,  with  today's development, the matter  returns  to  the 
court  of Mr. Jaffry. Before transferring the case,  Mr.  Justice 
Ahmed  dismissed  an  application filed  by  Mr.  Nawaz  Sharif's 
lawyers  that the ATC had no jurisdiction to hear  the  hijacking 
matter.
