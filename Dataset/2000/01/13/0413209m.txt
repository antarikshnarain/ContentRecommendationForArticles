Heavy snowfall in Kashmir brings relief


By Our Special Correspondent

SRINAGAR,  JAN. 12. Even as normal life was affected  in  Kashmir 
Valley,  the long awaited snowfall has come as a respite for  the 
people who have been facing a dry spell for a long time. For  the 
next couple of days heavy rain and snowfall have been forecast in 
Jammu and Kashmir.

Srinagar residents who had been praying for rain or snow for  the 
last few months woke up to a heavy snowfall on Wednesday morning. 
There  was light drizzle on Tuesday. Traffic came to a  halt  and 
the  life  was  thrown out of gear.  Transport  services  between 
Srinagar and other district headquarters were disrupted. However, 
people heaved a sigh of relief as they had been facing the  harsh 
dry spell.

Children were the happiest lot as they ventured out to play  snow 
games  especially around world famous Dal Lake on Boulevard  Road 
here. Reports from different parts of Kashmir suggested that  the 
first  snowfall in plains was received ``warmly'' by the  people. 
In  rural  areas special prayers were organised for the  snow  as 
lack  of  snowfall  last year had  been  proving  disastrous  for 
farmers.
