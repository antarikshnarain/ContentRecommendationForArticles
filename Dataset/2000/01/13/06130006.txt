Dutch firm offers conversion kits 


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI, JAN. 12. Vialle of the Netherlands has announced  its 
entry  in India through the launch of its compressed natural  gas 
(CNG) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) products at the Auto Expo 
2000 here. 

Vialle  will provide complete conversion kits which allow  petrol 
vehicles  to operate in bi-fuel mode. This conversion kit  allows 
for  vehicles to run on both petrol and CNG/LPG by  switching  to 
either fuel while in motion.

Pioneers in building customised products for vehicles, Vialle has 
specially designed and developed a technologically advanced, high 
quality, safe and economical CNG and LPG alternative fuel  system 
for the Maruti 800 car. 

The  Vialle pavilion was inaugurated today by Dr.  Gerrit  Ybema, 
Minister for Foreign Trade, Royal Netherlands Government.

Speaking  on the occasion, Mr. Hans Bruinsma, Managing  Director, 
Vialle  BV, Netherlands, said, ``With the constant  depletion  in 
the  reserves of conventional fuel sources, the need to look  for 
alternative sources of auto fuel has grown at a rapid pace.''

Vialle products will be available through Vialle Alternative Fuel 
Systems  Private  Limited, an Indo-Dutch  joint  venture  between 
Vialle  BV of the Netherlands and the Praja group of  India.  The 
Vialle's  Indian arm will market and provide service  support  to 
Vialle  customers in India. Indigenously developed by  Vialle  in 
the  Netherlands, these products will initially be  available  in 
Delhi  and Mumbai and at a later stage marketed in  other  metros 
and large cities.
