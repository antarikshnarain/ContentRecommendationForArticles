NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. The Prime Minister, Mr. A. B. Vajpayee,  will

measures in Jammu and Kashmir. 

 According to well-placed sources in the Government, the  meeting 
would also discuss in detail the counter-insurgency operations in 
the border State where militants have shown ``jehadi'' fervour in 
the post-Kargil phase and ``suicide squads'' have attacked  camps 
of security forces and State police over the past two months. 

 Apart  from the Prime Minister, the Union Home Minister, Mr.  L. 
K.  Advani,  the  Defence Minister,  Mr.  George  Fernandes,  the

the  Chief  Minister,  Dr. Farooq Abdullah  had  met  Mr.  Advani 
yesterday  and  discussed  the security scenario  in  the  State. 
Sources said a meeting of the core committee on Jammu and Kashmir 
was  also  held at the Cabinet Secretariat today  where  security 
situation came up for discussions. 

 It  is learnt that the Centre is keen to evolve a  multi-pronged 
strategy  to effectively tackle militancy in the Valley  and  has 
also taken note of the recent statements of Maulana Masood Azhar, 
the Harkat-ul-Ansar ideologue, from Pakistan vowing to send  more 
militants to the Valley.
