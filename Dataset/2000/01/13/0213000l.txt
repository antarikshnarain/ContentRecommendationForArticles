Press Council derecognises Editors' body


NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. The Press Council of India today announced it 
has   derecognised  the  All  India  Small  Newspapers   Editors' 
Conference (AISNEC) for filing false and incorrect information.

The  council  said  in  a press note  that  two  members  of  the 
conference - Mr. Pramod Arya and Mr. Ashok Arya - who had  become 
members  of the PCI by providing false information had also  been 
removed from the council.

The two ``nominated as members of the Press Council in March 1998 
have  ceased  to be members'' since it was established  that  the 
membership  was  secured  by  them  through  their   organisation 
(AISNEC) ``by furnishing incorrect information and not disclosing 
correct  facts.''  Their names ``have been  denotified''  by  the 
Government  of India through a gazette on November 19, 1999,  the 
press note said.
