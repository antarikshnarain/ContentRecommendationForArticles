New variety of Pusa Bathua


CHENOPODIUM,  IS  popularly  known  as  bathua.  A  new   variety 
chritened as `Pusa Bathua No. 1'. has been developed recently.

Its edible portion has 60 per cent more vitamin C and 10 per cent 
B-carotene than locally-available bathua so far. Tests have shown 
that  the variety gives more yield than other local types.It  can 
be grown on any type of soil but sandy loams are ideally- suited. 
It is highly salt tolerant. 

It  can  be grown successfully in saline- sodic soils  also.  The 
soil  is  prepared  well  by ploughing  3-4  times,  followed  by 
planking. Its sowing time is October-November. About 1.5-2.0  kg. 
seed  is  enough for a hectare crop. Since its seeds  are  small, 
they should not be sown more than 1 cm. deep. They should be sown 
in rows 30-40 cm. apart. Ensure that there is enough moisture  in 
the field.

Seedlings  are  raised  on  nursery beds.  About  3-4  weeks  old 
seedlings   or   attaining   6-8  cm.  height   are   ready   for 
transplanting.  Keep 10 cm. space from plant-to-plant and 30  cm. 
from   row-to-row.   A  light  irrigation  is   essential   after 
transplanting.  Apply  urea at 50 kg/ha in 3  dose  after  first, 
second and third cuttings. Its first picking becomes ready  40-45 
days  after  transplanting.  Subsequent  cuttings  can  be   done 
fortnightly.
