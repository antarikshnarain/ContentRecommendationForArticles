Convincing win for India


By Sanjay Rajan

MORATUWA,  JAN. 12. India warmed up for the battles ahead with  a 
122- run win over Bangladesh in the Group `B' of the Youth  World 
Cup at the De Soysa Stadium, here, today.

Leading the way in what turned out to be a one-sided affair  were 
the openers, Ravneet Ricky (61, 105b, 4x4) and Manish Sharma (55, 
95b, 5x4), who put on 131 runs.

Asked to bat first on a pitch still wet from overnight rain,  the 
two  displayed admirable concentration and command in their  30.3 
over tenure.

The Bangladesh mediumpacers, especially left-armer Bikash  Ranjan 
Das,  exploited the conditions well. Bikash, who has  represented 
the  senior  National team, had the openers in a spot  of  bother 
early  on,  getting  the ball to leave  the  right-handers  while 
bringing the odd delivery back in. He had Ricky edging behind but 
the wicketkeeper Md. Salim failed to hold on. Earlier, Ricky  was 
dropped in the covers off mediumpacer Tariqul Hossain.

Ricky needed the help of a runner after he slipped while  turning 
for  a  second run and twisted his ankle. He  displayed  grit  in 
batting  on. He didn't take the field later and it looks like  he 
won't recover in time for the next game against Holland in Matara 
on January 14.

The two openers played leg-spinner Mossadek Hossain freely  while 
handling the slow mediumpacer Hannan Sarker, who was tricky under 
these conditions, cautiously.

Rajin Salah Alam, a support off-spinner, had the two held in  the 
mid-wicket  area. India lost southpaw Yuveraj Singh and Sodhi  in 
their  bid to accelerate the run-rate. Skipper Md. Kaif  saw  the 
side past the 200-run mark while southpaw Niraj Patel guided  the 
team to its final score of 235 for five. 

Shalabh  Srivastava had Hannan Sarker off the first ball  of  the 
innings. The left-arm seamer looked good. He works up a fair pace 
and  derived  movement. Srivastava had the other  opener  Nahidul 
Haque  leg-before.  Left-arm spinner Anup Dave claimed  the  next 
three  wickets to fall, two of them caught by  wicketkeeper  Ajay 
Ratra.  Two  run outs made things worse for  Bangladesh  and  the 
innings was as good as over.

Indian coach Roger Binny was pleased with the performance.  ``The 
opposition was weak, but I'm happy that the lads are adjusting to 
the  overcast conditions. It's going to be like  this  throughout 
the tournament.''

The  other three matches were affected by rain.  While  runner-up 
New  Zealand  defeated  Holland in a 32-over  a  side  Group  `B' 
contest  and Pakistan beat Kenya in a Group `C' match reduced  to 
44 overs a team, the South Africa-Nepal Group `C' clash had to be 
abandoned midway. 

Jacques Rudolph scored an unbeaten 156 as South Africa ran up 295 
for  five  in the allotted 50 overs. In reply, Nepal was  24  for 
four in 12 overs when play had to be abandoned owing to rain.  As 
no result could be produced, the organising committee has decided 
to replay the match on a rest day.
