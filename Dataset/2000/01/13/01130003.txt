U.S. asks China to resume talks with Dalai Lama


WASHINGTON,  JAN.  12. The U.S. has called upon China  to  resume 
dialogue  with Tibetan spiritual leader, Dalai Lama, to  preserve 
Tibet's  unique cultural heritage following reports that  Beijing 
had launched a crackdown on the Tsurphu Monastery in Lhasa  which 
the 17th Karmapa fled.

``We  call on China to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai  Lama 
to  preserve  Tibet's  unique  religious,  cultural  and   ethnic 
heritage,'' the State Department spokesman, Mr. James Rubin, told 
presspersons on Tuesday.

The  U.S.,  he said, has been disturbed about  the  human  rights 
situation in Tibet and restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism. The U.S. 
is also concerned about reports that the monastery in the Tibetan 
capital  which  the  Lama  fled has been  raided  and  two  monks 
arrested, he said. ``We will be trying to confirm this report.''

``We have seen reports,'' Mr. Rubin said, ``that officials of the 
Tibetan Government-in-exile have requested the India to grant him 
asylum.  We  have no information about the status of  any  asylum 
request.''  The  Indian Government said on Tuesday  that  it  had 
received  no  `formal request' for asylum but that  any  decision 
would  be viewed in the context of historically close  ties  with 
Tibet.  An external affairs ministry official said he  was  ``not 
aware'' of any communication from Beijing on the issue.

In  a  veiled  warning yesterday, China had said  asylum  to  the 
Karmapa would be inconsistent with the Panch Sheel.
