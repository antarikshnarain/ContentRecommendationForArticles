More funds to modernise State police


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. In a bid to improve the infrastructure of the 
State  Police  forces, the Centre has  increased  the  allocation 
under  the  Union  Home Ministry's scheme  for  modernisation  of 
police forces from Rs. 50 crore to Rs. 200 crore per annum. 

 According to figures available with the official sources, during 
the 1969-70 to 1979-80, funds to the extent of Rs. 52 crores were 
released to the States and during the second decade of 1980-81 to 
1990-91 funds to the tune of Rs. 110 crores were released. During 
90s,  the  amount under the scheme for  modernisation  of  police 
forces  were substantially raised to Rs. 30 crore per annum  upto 
1995-96  and  was  fixed at Rs. 50 crore  annually  from  1996-97 
onwards. 

 It  is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments  to 
train, equip and modernise their police forces to keep pace  with 
the  changing security and law and order scenario since it  is  a 
State subject. However, in order to supplement the efforts of the 
State  Governments,  the Home Ministry has  been  implementing  a 
scheme  for modernisation of State police forces under  the  non- 
Plan since 1969-70.
