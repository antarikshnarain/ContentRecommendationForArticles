By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN.  12.  The Tamil Nadu  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  M. 
Karunanidhi, today called on the Prime Minister, Mr. Atal  Behari 
Vajpayee, and discussed with him number of issues concerning  the 
State.

 According to a close aide of the Chief Minister, Mr. Karunanidhi 
had originally intended his meeting with the Prime Minister as  a 
courtesy  call as Mr. Vajpayee has recently undergone a  cataract 
operation but the meeting went on for 45 minutes.

 The  Union Commerce and Industry Minister, Mr.  Murasoli  Maran, 
accompanied  the  Chief  Minister.  The  Finance  Minister,   Mr. 
Yashwant  Singh,  the  Finance Secretary,  Mr.  P.G.  Manked  and 
Secretary  in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr. N. K. Singh,  were 
also present.

 In  the course of his meeting Mr. Karunanidhi, who was  here  to 
attend  the  sub-committee meeting of  the  National  Development 
Council,  reiterated the view of the Tamil Nadu  Government  that 
there  should not be any deadline to the State for  adherence  to 
the  uniform sales tax floor rates and the matter should be  left 
to the states.

 Among other issues, the Chief Minister also raised the issue  of 
royalty  for Neiveli Lignite Corporation and early  clearance  of 
the container terminal at Chennai.

 Mr. Karunanidhi also had a meeting with the Union Home Minister, 
Mr.  Lal  Krishna  Advani, and exchanged  views  on  the  current 
political situation. Mr. Maran was also present on the occasion.
