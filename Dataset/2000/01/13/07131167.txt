Raman, Mouma triumph


By C. Rajshekhar Rao

LUCKNOW,  JAN.  12.  Chetan Baboor's quest  for  a  record  fifth 
consecutive men's title was squashed by S. Raman while Mouma  Das 
proved third time lucky in clinching her maiden women's title  in 
the  Sahara  61st Senior National and  Inter-State  table  tennis 
championships  at  the  Dr. Bhim Rao  Ambedkar  Stadium  here  on 
Wednesday.

Top  seed  Baboor's  journey  from  Sweden  thus  did  not  prove 
worthwhile as he was beaten 21-19, 10-21, 21-6, 21-18 by his best 
friend  and fellow Petroleum Sports Control Board  (PSCB)  player 
Raman. On the other hand, Mouma made the most of her third  final 
appearance  by playing positively and subduing N.R. Indu 25-  23, 
21-16, 21-14.

Raman,  figuring in his seventh final, won the second  time,  his 
first  title  coming  at Goa way back in 1992.  And  Lucknow  has 
proved to be a happy hunting ground for the left-hander, who  won 
the Northern India titles here in 1995 and 1997.

It had been a case of so near and yet so far for Raman since  his 
first title, with Baboor standing in his way thrice. But  Raman's 
consistent  game  did the trick today, as Baboor lost  his  first 
match  to an Indian since his loss to Raman at the Khar  Gymkhana 
championship in Mumbai two years back.

Raman,  however, was sporting enough to admit that Baboor  was  a 
better  player.  ``Chetan is definitely the best  player  in  the 
country  right  now,  but has not had the  best  of  tournaments, 
partly  because of his coming in late. I always thought I  had  a 
chance   of  winning,  and  once  into  the  match,  I  grew   in 
confidence,'' said Raman.

In the women's final, Mouma Das shook off an unsteady patch  that 
hit  her  in  the first game and raced away to  win  in  straight 
games.  Her forehand drives were almost always in, and N.R.  Indu 
failed to match her stroke for stroke.

The  scores were level virtually throughout the first  game,  but 
the  15-year-old Mouma did not give any leeway in  the  following 
games.  Indu's efforts at changing the pace of the game  went  in 
vain as Mouma unleashed some superb strokes from either flank.

``I  was nervous going into the final because I had lost  out  on 
opportunities the previous two times,'' admitted Mouma, who  lost 
to Poulomi Ghatak last year and M.S. Mythili the year before, but 
was still top-seeded here because of her consistency.
