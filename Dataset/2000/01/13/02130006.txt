'No request for asylum'


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, JAN. 12. The External Affairs Ministry said today that 
the  17th Karmapa who had defected from Tibet had  not  expressed 
any  desire  to move out of India and reiterated that  no  formal 
request  for  granting him asylum had been  received.``I  am  not 
aware (that) he has expressed a desire to move from where he is'' 
the foreign office spokesman said in response to a question.

The  spokesman  parried  most of the questions  on  the  Karmapa. 
``When I have something to announce, I will do so'', he said.

Asked  whether  China  had officially  approached  India  on  the 
subject,  the  spokesman  said he had ``nothing  on  whether  the 
Chinese  had  taken  up the issue of  defection  of  the  Tibetan 
religious leader through diplomatic channels.''

The  Principal Information Adviser to the Prime Minister, Mr.  H. 
K.  Dua,  when contacted, said that ``no decision so far  on  the 
status  of  the Karmapa has been taken.'' Official  sources  also 
denied  that the Dalai Lama had spoken to the Prime  Minister  on 
the subject.

Asked to comment on the reported statement by the Chinese Foreign 
Office  spokesman advocating that the two sides should  stick  to 
the Panchsheel doctrine, he said the Panchsheel principles formed 
the basis of inter-state relations the world over. He declined to 
comment on media reports that China had issued a veiled threat to 
India.

The   spokesman   confirmed  that  the  United   States   Special 
Coordinator on Tibet, Ms. Julie Taft, had met the Karmapa  during 
her visit to Dharamsala. He declined to comment on the  statement 
by  the U.S. State department spokesman, Mr. James  Rubin,  today 
advocating an improvement of the human rights situation in Tibet.
