the meeting of the State Executive on January 14.

He  said the leaders in different groups would tour State in  the 
next  few days to create confidence among the party workers.  The 
immediate task before the party was to contest the gram panchayat

P.G.R. Sindhia and Mr. Basavraj Rayareddy to attend the district-
level party workers' meet.
