Sonia warns against regressive forces 


VARANASI,  JAN. 29. The Congress(I) president and Leader  of  the 
Opposition  in the Lok Sabha, Ms. Sonia Gandhi,  today  cautioned 
the  people against some ``retrogressive forces which  wanted  to 
push the country backward''.

Some  fundamentalist forces were working to destroy  the  liberal 
and  tolerant social fabric of the country. Though they  made  so 
much  of  the  Indian culture, they had nothing to  do  with  the 
country's  cultural  values and humanity, Ms. Gandhi  said  at  a 
function  held  at  the Town Hall here to mark  the  700th  birth 
anniversay of the Vaishno saint, Swami Ramanand.

Ms.  Gandhi  said  Swami Ramanand had taught the  people  of  the 
country  the  ideals  of social equality and  tolerance  and  his 
pupils were drawn from different sections of the society  without 
any  discrimination  of caste, sex and religion. Saints  such  as 
Ramanand played a very crucial role in strengthening the unity of 
the country.

Ms.  Gandhi  said  Indira Gandhi and Rajiv  Gandhi  were  closely 
associated  with the Ramanand Math of Varanasi and they tried  to 
follow the saint's teachings.

Srimarthacharya Ramnareshachrya said various programmes would  be 
organised  during  the  year-long  celebrations  to  spread   the 
teachings of Swami Ramanand.
