Cong. wants clarity in Kashmir policy 


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI, JAN. 29. The Congress(I) has expressed grave  concern 
at the deteriorating situation in Jammu and Kashmir and  demanded 
that  the Centre prepare a coherent, well thought-out  policy  in 
the  State.  Condemning Pakistan's open support  to  trans-border 
terrorism  in  Kashmir,  the Congress(I)  said  that  India  must 
counter the threat effectively.

The  AICC spokesperson, Mr. Ajit Jogi, said in a statement  today 
that  the  Centre  seemed to be at a loss as to  what  course  of 
action  should  be followed. ``The country cannot  afford  to  be 
embroiled  in a situation similar to Kargil and the hijacking  of 
the Indian Airlines plane,'' he said pointedly.

The primary duty of the Government is to inform the country about 
the specific steps it intended to take to curb and terminate  the 
unabated terrorist activity in the State, he said.

In  the  absence  of a well-defined  anti-terrorist  policy,  the 
security forces were hampered in their duties and had  themselves 
become  subject to intense terrorist attacks. Mr.  Jogi  demanded 
that the Government give clear-cut instructions that the security 
forces could follow.
