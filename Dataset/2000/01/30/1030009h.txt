up. Transfer and promotion are on the cards for those in  defence 
and  police departments. Students and professionals may  have  to 
swim against strong currents. Politicians may be into fluctuating 
fortunes.   Financial  position  should  be  steady   and   good.

and the first three quarters of Visaka)

Politicians  will  win adherents easily and  do  well.  Promotion 
awaits   some  defence  and  police   personnel.   Sportspersons, 
students,  and professionals could experience  swaying  fortunes. 
Keep in control of finances and make sure you have funds to  meet 
extra  repair bills on vehicles and property. Speculation may  be 
mildly  gainful.  Avoid unconventional romance.  A  legal  matter 
pending  in court will be won. Business partners may stand  aloof 
and leave you holding the baby.
