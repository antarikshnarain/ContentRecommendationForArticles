Sagittarius


Sun sign Sagittarius (Nov. 23 to Dec. 20)

Relations between industrialists and contractors and the  labour-
force  they employ should grow amicable. Politicians could  scale 
new  heights of success. Working women and artists reap  benefits 
through a journey. Students, professionals and sportspersons must 
go about carefully; sticking to known paths will minimise  risks. 
Some in the uniformed services could be transferred abruptly.

Though  confronted  with obstacles, politicians will be  able  to 
reinforce their position. Those in government, defence and police 
are apt to get elevated and shifted to choice locations.  Working 
women and artists should find their dreams coming true. Financial 
flows  are  apt  to be ordinary. Yield from  the  races  and  the 
lottery  may be small. Be guarded in dealing with  associates  in 
business. Love and romance may fail to bring advantage.
