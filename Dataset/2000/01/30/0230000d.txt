PSU staff to go on strike on Feb. 2 


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI, JAN. 29. Employees of the Public Sector  Undertakings 
(PSUs)  are planning to go ahead with their nationwide strike  on 
February  2 following failure of the talks between their  leaders 
and  the  Union Labour Minister, Dr.  Satyanarayan  Jatiya,  here 
today. 

Claiming  that  the  meeting  could  not  come  to  any  positive 
conclusion  ``as the Minister did not give any commitment on  the 
issues  involved in the strike notice'', the five  Central  trade 
unions,  in a joint statement, asked the workers to proceed  with 
the strike as scheduled.

The  five  unions-  AITUC, CITU, HMS, UTUC (LS)  and  UTUC-  said 
issues  raised  in the strike notice given by  the  Committee  of 
Public  Sector Trade Unions were discussed at some length at  the 
meeting.

As  such the representatives of the trade unions did  not  accept 
the assurance given by the Minister that their concern  regarding 
the  interest  of  the  workers  would  be  communicated  to  the 
appropriate authorities. 

During the meeting, Dr. Jatiya told the trade union leaders  that 
he  had  talked  to the Prime Minister, as the  approach  of  his 
ministry  was to safeguard the interest of the workers.  He  also 
impressed  upon  them  that  he  himself  favoured  a  negotiated 
settlement and that the strike should be the last resort.
