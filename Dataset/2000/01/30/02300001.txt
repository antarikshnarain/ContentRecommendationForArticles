TDP backs Constitution review idea 


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI  JAN. 29 The Telugu Desam Party,  which  is  extending 
unconditional  outside support to the Vajpayee Government,  today 
endorsed the decision of the Government to set up a commission to 
review  the  Constitution in the light of the experience  of  the 
last  five decades, but said an all-party meeting be convened  to 
decide the terms of reference of such a panel.

The   TDP  Rajya  Sabha  MP  and  party  spokesperson,   Mr.   C. 
Ramachandraiah,  said ``the Government should take all  political 
parties into confidence and decide on the terms of reference  and 
the grey areas where the review is needed''.

In  response  to a question on the controversy  raised  over  the 
decision   of  the  Government  to  set  up  a  commission,   Mr. 
Ramachandraiah   said  it  would  be  better  to   have   elected 
representatives  in the review committee which could be  assisted 
by experts from other fields.

He said the TDP president and the Andhra Pradesh Chief  Minister, 
Mr.  N.  Chandrababu  Naidu,  had  suggested  a  review  of   the 
Constitution  even  before  BJP had mooted the  idea.  The  party 
spokesperson  was of the view that it would be worthwhile  to  go 
into  areas  such  as  Article  356  relating  to  imposition  of 
President's rule and providing more financial autonomy to States. 
He  said  that those who were opposing the review  were  doing  a 
``disservice'' to the nation.
