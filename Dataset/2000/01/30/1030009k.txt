Capricorn


Sun sign Capricorn (Dec. 21 to Jan. 19)

Women and those in fine arts and real estate are advised to  make 
use  of  this fruitful spell well.  Students,  professionals  and 
commission  agents  should be prepared to find the good  and  the 
indifferent.  Promotion  and shift will make defence  and  police 
personnel happy. Politicians will be safe it they maintain a  low 
profile.  Romance and speculation will not be favourable at  all. 
Financial flows may be a little more than satisfactory.  Business 
colleagues may be aloof and unhelpful.

Dealers in real estate will find things changing slowly to  their 
advantage.   Mixed  trends  are  likely  to  be  the   rule   for 
professionals and students. Politicians need to guard  themselves 
from  possible  abuse and attack. Financial dealings may  not  be 
entirely   sound.  Unexpected  expenditure  may  increase.   Keep 
yourself  well  away from public-related activities.  New  lines, 
romance  and speculation must be deferred. Partners in  business, 
servants and office subordinates may not be trustworthy.
