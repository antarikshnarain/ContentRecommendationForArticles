An 'India evening' at Davos 


DAVOS, JAN. 29. Putting behind heady debates on globalisation and 
business  deals,  several top business executives  and  political 
leaders took time off to get a glimpse and taste of Indian  dance 
and  cuisine at the ongoing annual meeting of the World  Economic 
Forum on Friday.

The  reception area for the ``India evening'' at  the  conference 
centre  was  full  even as a ``Garbha'' dance  and  fashion  show 
featuring top Indian models held the delegates spellbound for  an 
hour. An estimated 1,100 delegates attended the event.

The  show was billed as a prestigious event at the WEF summit  in 
this  secluded ski resort with one country getting the  pride  of 
place each year for a sharper focus.

Indian  participation at the meeting of the world's business  and 
political  elite was also significant this year since it was  the 
first  time that two regional leaders - the Andhra Pradesh  Chief 
Minister,   Mr.   N.  Chandrababu  Naidu,   and   his   Karnataka 
counterpart,  Mr.  S.  M.  Krishna, -  were  invited.  India  had 
organised a similar event in 1995 and the Confederation of Indian 
Industry lobbied for this year's event two years back.

Mr.  Naidu,  the  CII president, Mr.  Rahul  Bajaj,  and  India's 
Ambassador, Mr. K. P. Balakrishnan, greeted each of the delegates 
individually. The film star, Ms. Bhanupriya, and film-makers, Ms. 
Aparna Sen and Mr. Shekar Kapur, added a touch of glamour to  the 
event. Mr. Subhash Chandra of Zee Telefilms was also present.

The menu for the reception prepared by the Taj group ranged  from 
``seekh kababs'' and ``chicken tikkas'' to ``samosas'' and ``rice 
pulao''.  The aroma of Indian food filled the  conference  centre 
quite early in the day, said a delegate.

The  fashion  show by ten models presented  designer  collections 
from Mr. Suneet Verma and Ms. Ritu Kumar.
