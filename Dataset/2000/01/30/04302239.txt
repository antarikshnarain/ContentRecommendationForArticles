By Our Staff Reporter

VELLORE, JAN. 29. Mr. Mahendran (DMK) won the by-election to  the 
22nd  ward  of the Vellore municipal council  by  a  cling-hanger 
finish, by just two votes, following a recount.

As per the first counting, Ms. Umadevi was the winning candidate, 
as she was found to have won by a margin of 15 votes. This led to 
a  demand for recount. Mr. T. Mohan, commissioner of the  Vellore 
municipality  ordered a recount which resulted in  Mr.  Mahendran 
being declared elected by a margin of two votes.

Total  votes  - 2895; votes polled - 1549; invalid  votes  -  18; 
V.P.M.  Mahendran  (DMK)  -  729  declared  elected;  V.  Umadevi 
(AIADMK) - 727; T. R. Krishnaswamy (TMC) -75.

A heavy posse of police were posted outside the municipal  office 
where  the votes in yesterday's by-election were  counted.  There 
was tension following the initial results according to which  the 
AIADMK candidate was leading.

The  by-election was caused by the death of Mr. V. D. Devaraj  of 
the DMK.
