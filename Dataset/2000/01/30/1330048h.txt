When saffron heals all


INDIAN  ART  of  holistic healing is a  premium  service  in  the 
advanced West. The popularity of healing therapies like Ayurveda, 
Yoga, massage and Panchakarma, which claim five thousand years of 
history, is now evident in the online world too.

A  website  dedicated to Indian holistic healing practices  is  a 
barometer to the increasing interest of the world in  traditional 
healing in India. 

To  be launched on Monday at the International Ayurveda  Congress 
currently  underway in Chennai, this  site,  www.saffronsoul.com, 
has  nearly  1500  pages on the  various  disciplines  of  Indian 
holistic   medicine.   Go  to  any   particular   specialisation, 
everything one wants to know is there.

It is a kind of Deepak Chopra on the web: aesthetically designed, 
vibrant with colours, and impressively Indian. 

Though  not  overtly  banking on Indian exoticism,  the  site  is 
compellingly  Indian,  user-friendly and interactive. ``It  is  a 
single-point source for all the disciplines of holistic  healing, 
helping you to plan and revitalise your health,'' says Mr. Dinesh 
Vazirani  of  Planet  saffron,  the  company  behind  the   site. 
Saffronsoul also is a forum for Indian companies specialising  in 
traditional  products to use the online medium to tap the  global 
market.  It carries information on research, institutes,  resorts 
and healing centres around the world.

According  to Mr. Vazirani, the site came about on requests  from 
professionals in the field. ``There is a tremendous global demand 
for products and services in the sector''.

The  site is also a platform for interaction among  practitioners 
and  users.  There  are bulletin boards, chat  rooms  and  online 
diagnostic tools. 

On  its home-turf saffronsoul can also act as a  comeback-vehicle 
for traditional healing practices.
