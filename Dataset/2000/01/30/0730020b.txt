Leko holds Kasparov 


By Arvind Aaron 

WIJK  AAN ZEE, JAN. 29. In an encounter between two of  the  four 
undefeated players in the meet, Peter Leko of Hungary snatched  a 
draw  from  Garry Kasparov of Russia as lead  positions  remained 
unchanged  with  draws in the eleventh round of the  Corus  chess 
tournament here at De Moriaan on Friday.

Kasparov  tops  the  standings after  eleven  rounds  with  eight 
points,  one  point ahead of Leko and Kramnik, who are  on  seven 
points.  On  6.5 points in the fourth  position  are  Viswanathan 
Anand  and  the  day's  winners,  Michael  Adams  and   Alexander 
Morozevich.

Judit  Polgar found her first victim in Piket, beating him in  45 
moves  with  the  white pieces. Piket had survived  many  a  time 
pressure  but  here he overlooked a pin on his rook on  the  39th 
turn that resulted in his second defeat. 

Van  Wely's  two-advantage  was insufficient for him  to  win  as 
Nikolic managed to stalamate himself in 94 moves. It was a chancy 
game  and the Dutchman was left with less than 90 seconds in  the 
seventh  hour when he let Nikolic escape with an undeserved  half 
point.

lThe results (round 11): Judit Polgar (Hun) bt J. Piket (Ned), V. 
Korchnoi  (Swz) drew V. Kramnik (Rus), G. Kasparov (Rus) drew  P. 
Leko  (Hun),  L. Van Wely (Ned) drew P. Nikolic (Bih),  M.  Adams 
(Eng)  bt  J.  Timman (Ned), A. Morozevich (Rus)  bt  S.  Lputian 
(Arm), N. Short (Eng) drew V. Anand (Ind).

The  standings after round 11: 1 G.Kasparov 8/11, 2-3  V.Kramnik, 
P.Leko  7  each, 4-6 M.Adams, V.Anand, A.Morozevich 6.5  each,  7 
J.Piket  6, 8-9 P.Nikolic, J.Timman 5 each, 10-11  Judit  Polgar,
