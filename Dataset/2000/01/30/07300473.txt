Chiranjeev in joint 22nd spot


PERTH,  JAN.  29. Chiranjeev Milkha Singh improved  his  position 
with  a  one-under  71 in the third round of the  $  1.1  million 
Heineken Classic golf tournament at the Vines Resort course  here 
on Saturday.

From  his overnight joint 25th, Chiranjeev moved up to the  joint 
22nd place, at an overall three-under 213. He was tied with  five 
others including the Australian legend Greg Norman.

Second-round  leader,  Thomas Bjorn of Denmark,  shot  his  third 
successive 68, but even that was not good enough to stop the  New 
Zealander, Michael Campbell, from taking over the sole lead. 

Campbell, winner of the season-opening Johnnie Walker Classic  in 
Taipei, shot a seven-under 65 for a total of 14-under 202. 

Bjorn was two strokes away.

The scores: Michael Campbell (Nzl) (68, 69, 65) 202; Thomas Bjorn 
(Den)  (68,  68, 68) 204; Alastair Forsyth (Sco)  (72,  68,  68), 
Peter O'Malley (Aus) (68, 71, 69), Stephen Leaney (Aus) (70,  69, 
69), Alex Cejka (Ger) (72, 66, 70) and Johan Skold (Swe) (71, 67, 
70) 208; Ernie Els (RSA) (72, 69, 68) and David Smail (Nzl)  (70, 
70, 69).
