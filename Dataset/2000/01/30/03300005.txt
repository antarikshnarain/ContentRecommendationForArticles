By Amit Baruah

ISLAMABAD,  JAN.  29. A prosecution witness  today  informed  the 
anti-terrorism court (ATC) of Mr. Justice Rehmat Hussain  Jaffry, 
that  the  IGP  Sindh had ordered him to  arrest  General  Pervez 
Musharraf at the Nawabshah airport and then shift him to a  guest 
house.

Deposing  in  the  plane hijack case  against  the  former  Prime 
Minister,  Mr. Nawaz Sharif, the witness, Mr.  Ehsanullah  Gondal 
(the then SP of Nawabshah) said the IGP Sindh, Mr. Rana  Maqbool, 
had  ordered him to arrest Gen. Musharraf and also asked  him  to 
mobilise police force at the Nawabshah airport to ensure that the 
orders to detain Gen. Musharraf were carried out.

Mr. Gondal said Mr. Rana Maqbool had informed him over  telephone 
at  about 6.30 p.m. on October 12, 1999, that Gen. Musharraf  had 
been replaced by Lt. Gen. Khwaja Ziauddin. 

In  a related development, Mr. Sharif's lawyers informed the  ATC 
that  some of their senior colleagues were being ``harassed''  by 
the military regime. They claimed that power supply to the  rooms 
of Mr. Ijaz Batalvi and Mr. Khwaja Sultan, was cut-off early this 
morning, making them late for court.
