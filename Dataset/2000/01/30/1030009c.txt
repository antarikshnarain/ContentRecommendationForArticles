Taurus


Sun sign Taurus (April 21 to May 20)

Real  estate  dealers, artists, career women and  sports  persons 
should see improvement. Expenses may arise over auspicious events 
and travel. Moneywise you should be on a firm wicket with friends 
and  relatives  willing to help when necessary. Minor  gains  are 
possible  from speculation. The romantically inclined should  not 
press  their  suits too hard now. Minor official  pin-pricks  are 
best ignored. Some of you may look for a job shift. 

Moon  in RISHABHA (Stars - Krittika last three Quarters,  Rohini, 
Mrigasira first two quarters)

Unexpected  transfers  may  come  for  those  in  the   uniformed 
services.  Finances  may  not be all that  comfortable  to  spend 
freely.  Investments in games of chance and races are not at  all 
worth  trying.  Don't get into unnecessary problems  by  pursuing 
matters  related  to the heart. Work may be a difficult  time  to 
handle. 

Chandrashtama:  From  10-10 a.m. on February 1 to 10-47  p.m.  on 
February 3.
