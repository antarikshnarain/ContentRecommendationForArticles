Heroes' welcome to under-19 champs


CHENNAI,  JAN. 29. A reception befitting the world  champion  was 
accorded to the Indian under-19 cricket team, which returned from 
Colombo  on  Saturday  evening after annexing the  World  Cup  on 
Friday. 

Officials  headed by Mr.A.C.Muthiah, President, Board of  Control 
for  Cricket  in  India, welcomed the players  with  flowers  and 
garlands. 

Prof. Nandakumar, the manager, was ecstatic while recounting  the 
progress of the squad towards the title. 

He  said initially the team had to encounter a few problems.  The 
matter  was  brought  to the notice of  the  BCCI  President  who 
offered every assistance and urged the players to concentrate  on 
their task. 

Once the minor irritants were removed, Prof. Nandakumar said, the 
boys went from strength to strength and did ``remarkably  well.'' 
He admitted that collectively, the squad was extremely strong and 
talented. 

In  the  end the players proved that they were the  best  in  the 
world.  Prof.  Nandakumar said the team had to perform  before  a 
crowd of 25,000 on the final day rooting for the home side. 

He thanked the support and co-operation extended by the staff  of 
the Indian High Commission. 

Skipper  Mohammad Kaif termed the outcome as a result  of  ``team 
effort'' and paid rich tributes to the role played by the  coach, 
Roger  Binny. While admitting it would be invidious to name  this 
or that player as outstanding, Kaif pinpointed the splendid  role 
played by Saulab Srivastav and Mrutyunjay Tripathi on the tour. 

``Everyone contributed his part well,'' Kaif summed up.
