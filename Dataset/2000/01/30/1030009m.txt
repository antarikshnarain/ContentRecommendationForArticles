Pisces


Sun sign Pisces (Feb. 19 to March 20)

Some  eligible single natives will succeed in  locating  suitable 
life  partners in due course. Financially, you will have  nothing 
whatsoever  to worry about and commitments can be met with  ease. 
Avoid  laying very high stakes in speculation.  Romantic  affairs 
may  afford   happiness.  Health of spouse  may  come  under  the 
weather.  Business  partners and brothers or sisters may  not  be 
helpful.   Business  persons  are  advised  to  maintain   proper 
accounts.  Realtors  and industrialists can hope  for  some  mild 
growth.  Politicians have to be prepared to meet both  favourable 
and not so favourable winds.

Those  in fine arts, hotel and travel business and working  women 
flourish. Politicians will have a say on all important decisions. 
Government  servants  are  moved to higher posts  and  to  better 
locations. Students, realtors and professionals experience a  few 
benefits  during this mixed spell. Business travel  should  prove 
beneficial.  An auspicious get-together is sure to  bring  cheer. 
Careful  speculation will help. In business, associates could  be 
somewhat helpful.  Family problems must be solved without anybody 
getting hurt.
