Sun sign Cancer (June 21 to July 20)

Financial flows may be reasonably satisfactory. Friends, business 
partners  and  relatives are not going to  be  cooperative.  Deal 
carefully  with grown-up children; a rash move by you  may  cause 
heavy damage. Keep well away from games or events of chance.  The 
self-employed may find things not moving according to plans. Some 
natives  may  apply  for better jobs. Do take  care  of  spouse's 
health  personally.  Realtors,  working  women,  politicians  and 
artists must lie very low.

Students  and  professionals should experience  benefits,  though 
there  may be some minor hurdles. Some of you may be inclined  to 
switch jobs. Government servants too may be forced to seek shifts 
or  proceed on leave. Manage your affairs on your  own.  Postpone 
new  lines,  romance  and  speculation.  Money  inflows  must  be 
judiciously husbanded. Remember that money saved is money gained. 
Politicians must be very careful in their words and deeds.
