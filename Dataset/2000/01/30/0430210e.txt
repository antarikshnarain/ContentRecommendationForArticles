By Our Special Correspondent

HUBLI, JAN. 29. The practical examinations of engineering courses 
conducted  by  the Visvesvaraya Technological  University,  which 
commenced  from today, were boycotted by teachers,  according  to 
Mr. Nagaraj, President of the Visvesvaraya Technological  College 
Teachers' Association.

Mr. Nagaraj said here today that the association had given a call 
for  a state-wide boycott of engineering examinations in  protest 
against the ``discriminatory treatment'' meted out to engineering 
college  teachers, who had been denied revised pay scales as  per 
the Fifth Pay Commission recommendations. 

Mr.  Nagaraj claimed that the external examiners had declined  to 
visit  the colleges. The boycott was total in Gogte Institute  of 
Technology,  Belgaum, KLE Society Engineering  College,  Belgaum, 
SDM Engineering College, Dharwad, BVB Engineering College, Hubli, 
Basaveshwara  Engineering College, Bagalkot and  PDA  Engineering 
College, Gulbarga. In Bangalore, Mr. Nagaraj said, the orders  on 
examinations,  had been returned to the Regional Officer  of  the 
university. Teachers boycotted the practical examinations in R.V. 
Engineering  College,  BMS  Engineering  College,  M.S.   Ramaiah 
Engineering  College,  Gousia Engineering College and  ten  other 
colleges. 

In  Tumkur, teachers in the SSIT, whose chairman is the  Minister 
for  State for Higher Education, Dr. Parameshwar,  boycotted  the 
examination. A delegation of the association was leaving for  New 
Delhi  to meet the Union Minister of Human  Resource  Development 
and  the AICTE officials on January 31. The  engineering  college 
teachers  all over the State were sore over the fact  that  while 
the teachers in the agricultural universities were given  revised 
pay scales, they were denied the benefit, Mr. Nagaraj said.
