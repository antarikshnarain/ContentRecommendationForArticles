Leo


Sun sign Leo (July 21 to Aug. 21)

Don't  be over-enthusiastic in finalising a  particular  marriage 
proposal;  a  better match may be on the cards. The  birth  of  a 
child  or  grandchild will see everyone around in good  cheer.  A 
brief  trip  away from home is likely. Trim your expenses,  as  a 
coat  to  its cloth. Set aside romance and speculation  for  now. 
Have   a   fever  or  eye  trouble  attended   to.   Drive   with 
concentration. Siblings may be aloof and unhelpful. 

Moon  in  SIMHA (Stars -  Makha,  Poorvaphalguni,  Uttaraphalguni 
first quarter)

Ongoing    trends   enable   students,   politicians,    artists, 
professionals, career women and those in the service industry  to 
reach  their  targets. Young ones will do  exceedingly  well  and 
fetch  honours. Financial matters will be smooth, as long as  you 
rein in spending. Love and romance could bring some warm  favour. 
Be careful in moving with even close relatives who may be touchy. 
Try not to lean too much on business partners and friends.
