By Our Staff Reporter

VANIYAMBADI,  JAN.  29.  The Tamil Nadu Chief  Minister,  Mr.  M. 
Karunanidhi today defended the Government's decision to introduce 
Tamil as the medium of instruction upto the fifth standard.

Participating   at  a  function  organised  by  the   Vaniyambadi 
Muthamizh  Mantram  to confer the ``Kavikko award'' on  him,  Mr. 
Karunanidhi  said  that he was able to make an  attempt  to  come 
forward to introduce Tamil as the medium of instruction upto  the 
fifth standard after years of pondering over the subject.

The  Chief Minister said several education committees right  from 
the  one headed by Late Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, noted  Educationist 
and former President of India, have recommended education through 
the mother tongue in order to ensure the wholesome development of 
the child.

The  Chief Minister said that the Constitution should be  amended 
without  affecting  its  basic structures in order  to  make  all 
national  languages  as administrative languages  and  to  ensure 
devolution of greater powers to the States.

He  appealed to the Central Government to formulate a  scheme  by 
which  all  national  languages  would  be  made   administrative 
languages  on  a  priority basis. An expert  committee  could  be 
appointed to accomplish the task he added.
