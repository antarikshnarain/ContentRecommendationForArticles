Quick  estimates  figures  released by  the  Central  Statistical

Pushing  up the GDP growth rate has been the  agriculture  sector 
which is said to have recorded a growth of 7.2 per cent  (advance 
estimates  were  of  a  5.3 per cent  growth)  in  1998-99  while 
manufacturing was at a low of 3.6 per cent (advance estimates had 
put  it at 5.7 per cent). Electricity, gas and water  supply  was 
estimated  to  have grown at the rate of 7.9 per cent  while  the 
construction  sector registered a growth of 5.7 per cent.  Trade, 
hotels  and  restaurants were up 8.4 per  cent  while  transport, 
storage  and  communication  was  up  7.4  per  cent.  Financing, 
insurance, real estate and business services were up 6.1 per cent 
while  community, social and personal services grew by  10.9  per 
cent. The total GDP growth rate was estimated to be 6.8 per cent.

The  per capita income at 1993-94 prices was estimated to be  Rs. 
9,739  for 1998-99 against Rs. 9,271 for 1997-98, registering  an 
increase of 5 per cent during the year. The per capita income  at 
current prices was estimated to be Rs. 14,682 in 1998-99  against 
Rs. 12,729 in the preceding year, registering an increase of 15.3 
per cent.

The  gross  domestic  saving at current prices  was  put  at  Rs. 
393,601  crores during 1998-99 against Rs. 374,415 crores  during 
1997-98,  constituting 22.3 per cent of the GDP at market  prices 
as  against 24.7 per cent in the preceding year. In  this,  while 
house  hold savings and private corporate savings have  shown  an 
increase,  there  has  been a steep fall in the  savings  of  the 
public sector.
