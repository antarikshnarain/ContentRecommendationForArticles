Aries


Sun sign Aries (March 21 to April 20)

Those  in fine arts and career women could introduce their  ideas 
successfully.  Students,  professionals  and  traders  will  find 
favourable  trends.  Finances may be just manageable  with  extra 
resources   being   mobilised  to  meet   unexpected   items   of 
expenditure.  Avoid speculation. Travel is likely. Be careful  in 
dealing   with   domestic  help  and  business   associates.   An 
accommodating approach will help you find peace in the family.

Moon  in  MESHA  (Stars  - Aswini,  Bharani  and  Krittika  first 
quarter)

A  fairly steady spell will enable professionals in all walks  of 
life  and students to make good progress. Sound support  will  be 
available  for the asking, from all concerned. But,  do  remember 
that silence and patience will help manage your affairs smoothly. 
Have firm control over finances, as expenses are likely to soar. 

Chandrashtama:  Continuing  from  last  week  to  10-10  a.m.  on 
February 1.
