'A ploy to divert attention' 


By Our Staff Reporter

KANNUR,   JAN.  29.  The  senior  Congress(I)  leader,   Mr.   K. 
Karunakaran,  has  said  that the BJP-led  Government's  plan  to 
constitute  a committee to review the Constitution is a  ploy  to 
divert the attention of the people from its failures.

Speaking to reporters here today, he said the Central  Government 
was going ahead with its plan to set up a committee to review the 
Constitution   with  the  knowledge  that  no  Government   could 
completely  revise it. Moreover, the present dispensation at  the 
Centre did not have the proper mandate to revise the Constitution 
which reflects the spirit of the nation's diversity, he said.

Instead  of asking for a review of the Constitution, the  Central 
Government  should at least name the Articles that they  believed 
were  putting obstacles to the stability of the nation, he  said. 
There were far more serious things to be done to address the real 
problems  being  faced  by the Government than  revision  of  the 
Constitution,  he said. Differences appeared to have  cropped  up 
among the BJP's alliance partners on the issue, he said.

Stating  that the Central Government did not have  any  programme 
other that anti-Congressism, Mr. Karunakaran said that there  was 
not even a semblance of unity among the 24 parties in the  ruling 
NDA led by the BJP. Stating that India once used to enjoy support 
and  respect of majority of the nations, he said the country  now 
stood isolated thanks to the policies of the Central  Government. 
``We  have more enemies than friends now'', he said.  The  CPI(M) 
leader,  Mr.  V.  S. Achuthanandan's call for  agitation  in  the 
Kollam  S.N.  College issue amounted to  intimidation,  he  said. 
Blaming   the  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  E.  K.  Nayanar,  for   not 
intervening to settle the college issue, he said the Government's 
stand on the issue would only strengthen the communal forces.
