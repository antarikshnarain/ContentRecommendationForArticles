Virgo


Sun sign Virgo (Aug. 22 to Sept. 22)

Working women and those in fine arts may witness mixed  fortunes. 
Students,  professionals  and commission traders are  to  benefit 
from improving tempo. Court matters will proceed to your  liking. 
Ration your words and keep emotions under control in dealing with 
older children. Business associates may lack interest in  running 
even  day-to-day  activities. Defer  fresh  ventures.  Auspicious 
celebrations may have to be postponed. 

Moon in KANYA (Stars - the last three quarters of Uttaraphalguni, 
Hashta and the first two quarters of Chitta)

Students   will   find   the  going   better.   Contractors   and 
industrialists  should  step up efforts to  meet  their  targets. 
There  is no point in banking on support from  friends,  business 
colleagues  and  relatives.  Speculation is to  be  avoided.  New 
business ventures may move lethargically. Grown-up wards may  get 
a little out of hand to tackle; be very tactful. Strictly curtail 
frivolous expenditure.
