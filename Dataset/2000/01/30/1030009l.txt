Aquarius


Sun sign Aquarius (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)

Financial  inflows may come under some strain;  hence,  judicious 
spending is a must. Keep your future plans strictly to  yourself. 
Siblings  may  refuse to cooperate. Colleagues  and  subordinates 
will  evade  responsibilities. Work of servants may be  far  from 
satisfactory.  Speculation must be avoided. In business  and  new 
ventures,  expansion plans and construction activities might  not 
proceed on anticipated lines. 

Moon  in  KUMBHA  (Stars - the last two  quarters  of  Dhanishta, 
Satabhishak, and the first three quarters of Poorvabhadrapada)

Working  women and people in fine arts, travel and  entertainment 
industry  will  be  happy  with  the  way  things  happen.  Mixed 
prospects  are in store for realtors. Politicians are advised  to 
play  their  cards  close  to  the chest  and  keep  out  of  the 
limelight. Sudden transfer orders out of the blue may  disconcert 
some  government servants. Some of you may have to be  away  from 
family on business or official duties.
