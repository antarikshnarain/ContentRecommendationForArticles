Sonia to lead march to PM's house today


NEW DELHI, JAN. 29. The Congress (I) president, Ms. Sonia Gandhi, 
along with the Congress Working Committee members, would march to 
Prime  Minister's house tomorrow morning in a move to  pressurise 
the BJP-ruled Gujarat Government to withdraw its order permitting 
its employees to join the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

Significantly, the party had chosen the martyrdom day of  Mahatma 
Gandhi  to  submit a memorandum to the Prime Minister,  Mr.  Atal 
Behari  Vajpayee,  pressing for revocation of  the  controversial 
order.
