Media twisted my remarks on Ram temple, says Gupta


NEW DELHI, JAN. 29. The construction of a Ram temple at the Babri 
Masjid site in Ayodhya will not take place until the courts clear 
it or the dispute is resolved through dialogue, the Uttar Pradesh 
Chief Minister, Mr. Ram Prakash Gupta, said today. Claiming  that 
his  remarks  to  the press on  Friday  were  misinterpreted  and 
newspapers  had drawn their own conclusions, Mr. Gupta said in  a 
statement here that his Government was committed to the  National 
Democratic  Alliance  agenda.  ``I had made  it  clear  that  the 
construction  of a temple or mosque is not the responsibility  of 
governments. The Government would intervene only when there is  a 
law and order problem.'' 

``I  had asserted that the Uttar Pradesh Government and  BJP  are 
committed  to the NDA agenda and our policies would be  based  on 
those principles,'' he said.
