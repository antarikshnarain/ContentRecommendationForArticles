INSAT-3B launch in March


PARIS, JAN. 18. India's INSAT-3B communication satellite will  be 
launched from the Kourou space station in French Guyana in  March 
and  once in operation, it will augment  India's  satellite-based 
mobile communication system, officials said here today.

The  2,070  kg  satellite, the first  of  the  INSAT-3  satellite 
series,  will  be put in the geo-stationary orbit by  a  Ariane-5 
rocket in mid-March, Arianespace officials said.

This will be the second commercial launch of Ariane-5 and  INSAT-
3B will have Asia Star satellite owned by World Space as its  co-
passenger, unlike the INSAT 2-E which had a dedicated launch last 
year by an Ariane-4 rocket, officials said.

The INSAT-3B, designed for a mission life of 12 years, will carry 
12  extended C band transponders, three Ku band transponders  and 
one MSS transponder.
