COLOMBO,  JAN.  18.  A bomb, packed with  deadly  explosives  and 
shrapnel, was discovered and defused in Colombo today.

The bomb weighing 250 grammes and packed with ball- bearings, was 
found  near  a police residential quarters at Kotahena  in  north 
Colombo, the state TV said. 

A  police officer passing by saw a worker handling a plastic  bag 
with a device and promptly called in the bomb disposal squad  who 
defused it.

There has been concern over the security situation here after the 
attempt  by  a suicide bomber to assassinate the  President,  Ms. 
Chandrika Kumaratunga, on December 18.

In  the eastern Batticaloa district, one civilian was killed  and 
five others injured when the LTTE opened fire at the bus in which 
they were travelling, the Defence Ministry said.
