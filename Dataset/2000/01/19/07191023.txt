Top three seeds bite the dust


By Kalyan Ashok

BANGALORE,  JAN. 18. The Court No. 1 at the Century  Club  turned 
out  to  be  the `graveyard of seeds' as the top  three  -  Aisam 
Quereshi  of  Pakistan, Prahlad Srinath of  India  and  Vladislav 
Svarc  of Slovakia - perished one after the other on  a  dramatic 
day's   play  in  the  $  10,000  Wearhouse-ITF  Futures   Tennis 
Championship  here on Tuesday. There was something to  cheer  for 
the Indian supporters as Mustafa Ghouse pulled off a hard  fought 
6-3,  3-6,  6-4  victory over the sixth seeded  Nir  Welgreen  of 
Israel. 

The top seeded Quereshi, the Pakistan No. 1 went down 4-6, 3-6 to 
Markus Kanellos of Austria.

The  18-year  old Kanellos had a bit of trouble  with  his  first 
serve but he packed a solid second one and kept a consistent flow 
of good returns to unsettle Quereshi. In the first set,  Kanellos 
cracked  his rival in the ninth game. Leading 0-40 on  Quereshi's 
serve,  he saw the Pakistani bounce back with some good  volleys. 
Though  Quereshi forced a deuce, Kanellos kept the  pressure  and 
went on to shut the set at 6-4. 

Kanellos  dictated the pace in the second set too with  an  early 
break.  He snuffed out Quereshi's bid for a revival and  won  the 
set  and  match  6-3.  `` My biggest  win  in  Futures``  exulted 
Kanellos, who hovers around 1,200 in the ITF ranking.

There  was a sizeable crowd to cheer Srinath, but  his  big-built 
Dutch rival, Sander Groen proved to be a spoilsport as he  felled 
the big Indian hope at 6-3, 6-4. 

In the first set, Sander raced to a 3-0 with a break in the third 
which  he later stretched to 4-1 and from then on,  Srinath  came 
under pressure. After dropping the set at 3-6, Srinath's troubles 
continued  in  the second set also, as he  kept  making  unforced 
errors  and  dropped the serve in the third. Srinath did  make  a 
belated  surge  by serving and volleying better, but  the  effort 
came too late as Sander pulled the plug at 6-4.

It was a sweet revenge for Denis Golovanov as he dumped the third 
seed,  Ladislav Svarc of Slovakia 6-4, 6-3. The Russian had  lost 
to  Svarc  in the final of the Hyderabad event. But  he  came  on 
pretty strongly today with his good groundstrokes and served hard 
to put Svarc on the defensive. 

Two more Indians - Rohan Bopanna and Kamala Kannan bowed out. The 
Russian,  Smolenski Ivanov treated the friendly serve  of  Kamala 
Kannan  like a cannon fodder and rolled to a 6-3, 6-3  win  while 
Boris  Borgula of Slovakia drubbed Rohan Bopanna 6-0, 6-2  in  47 
minutes, which incidentally was shortest match of the day.
