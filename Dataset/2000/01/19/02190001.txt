India supports Russian drive in Chechnya


By Atul Aneja

NEW DELHI, JAN. 18. Without criticising the Taliban, India  today 
expressed  solidarity  with  Russia  in  its  confrontation  with 
Chechen rebels. 

Reacting  to  reports  of  the  recognition  of  Chechnya  as  an 
independent State by the Taliban, the foreign office today  side-
stepped criticism of Afghanistan's Islamic extremists. 

Instead,  its  spokesman  focussed  on  New  Delhi's  backing  to 
Moscow's drive against the Chechen rebels.

``The  Government and people of India have expressed  their  full 
solidarity  with  the  Government  and  people  of  the   Russian 
Federation  as they tackle the grave crisis confronting  them  in 
the Republic of Chechnya in the Russian Federation. 

The  Government  of India fully supports the  Government  of  the 
Russian Federation in the steps taken by it in the protection  of 
its  constitutional order and territorial integrity and does  not 
welcome  encouragement  to  forces which  undermine  this'',  the 
spokesman said in response to a query. 

This  reaction assumes importance in the light of  what  analysts 
here  described as New Delhi's ``softness'' towards  the  Taliban 
ever  since  the  hijacking  of  the  Indian  Airlines  plane  to 
Kandahar.
