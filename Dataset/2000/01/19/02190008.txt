India urged to resume talks with Pak.


CALCUTTA,  JAN. 18. Pakistan wants to normalise ties  with  India 
and the Indian authorities should seize the opportunity and start 
talks for improving bilateral relations, delegates attending  the 
South Asia peace meet said here today. ``Gen. Musharraf is a  man 
of peace. He wants to normalise relations with India. This is the 
time  when India can start negotiations,'' member  of  Pakistan's 
Human   Rights  Commission  Brig  R.  Rao  Hamid  said   at   the 
inauguration   of  the  South  Asia  peace  meet  and   all-India 
constructive workers' conference here.

Stating  that  over the past year, the people of  both  countries 
``had   lived   in  fear  of  the  nuclear  bomb   and   reckless 
leadership'', Brig. Hamid, also a founder-member of the Pakistan- 
India Forum for Peace, said ``millions'' of his countrymen wanted 
to live in peace and harmony with India.

The three-day meet and all-India constructive workers  conference 
is  being organised by Akhil Bharat Rachnatmak Samaj and  Harijan 
Sevak Samity.
