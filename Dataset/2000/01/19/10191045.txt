dated January 19, 1950: Commonwealth unity


Britain`s  Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Mr.  P. 
J.  Noel-Baker, who was on a goodwill visit to India,  emphasised 
the  role of the Commonwealth in world affairs, at the same  time 
making it clear that it was not an exclusive body. He agreed with 
India's  Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, that peace and  prosperity 
were  indivisible  and that there could be no  peace  unless  the 
people of the world were given a tolerable standard of life.

One  of  the tasks of the Commonwealth, according  to  Mr.  Noel-
Baker,  would be to try and apply Mahatma Gandhi's principles  of 
non-violence to national and international affairs.

Mr.  Noel-Baker said that the countries of the Commonwealth  were 
agreed  that  there could be no peace unless the peoples  of  the 
world  were given a tolerable standard of life. ``As  your  Prime 
Minister,  Pandit Nehru, says so often, the social  consciousness 
of the nation of the world has been aroused and they now  believe 
that social justice is an essential condition for peace.''

The problems of peace and prosperity, said Mr. Noel-Baker,  could 
not be solved within the framework of the Commonwealth alone.

Separation of Andhra

Reports  from New Delhi said on January 18, that Andhra  was  not 
likely to be included in the Schedule of States mentioned in  the 
new  Constitution, and hence, the Andhra province might not  come 
into existence with effect from January 26. The main difficulties 
appeared to be legal, practical and financial.
