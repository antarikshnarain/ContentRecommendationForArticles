By Our Staff Correspondent

MUMBAI,  JAN.  18.  The  Aditya Birla  group  has  announced  the 
formation  of an alliance with the U.S.-based Lawson Software,  a 
leading  global  software  company. The new  entity,  created  to 
support the alliance, is named `Lawson Competency Centre' and  is 
a division of Birla Consultancy & Software Services (BCSS)  which 
is the software arm of the organisation and a division of Grasim, 
the Aditya Birla group's flagship company. 

Elaborating the move, Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla, the Aditya  Birla 
group Chairman said, ``Knowledge based industries offer  enormous 
growth.  This  sunrise sector has the  advantage  of  shareholder 
value creation in a short time frame. With this focus, we decided 
to  give significant thrust to BCSS and elevate it to  an  engine 
for the growth of our software business. 

To  give BCSS the cutting edge of technology and propel it  to  a 
leadership  position  we have formed a  strategic  alliance  with 
Lawson, who are among Fortune's top private software companies.'' 

A management committee comprising two members each from the Birla 
group  and Lawson Software will provide the  strategic  direction 
and  guidance to this centre. Mr. Ashok Sand has been  named  the 
CEO  of  BCSS with effect from February 1 and  will  oversee  the 
operations of Lawson Products Competency Centre.
