LG Electronics' investment plans


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN.  18. LG Electronics today  announced  plans  to 
invest $50 million in its Indian subsidiary during the year 2000. 
The  investment  will cover realignment to bring the  PC  monitor 
business  under  its own control, a new manufacturing  plant  and 
launch  of  16 new products and commencement  of  its  e-commerce 
drive with the launch of the web site www.lgindia.com.

The $50 million of investments during calendar 2000 will be  part 
of  the  $289 million (Rs. 1,040 crores) planned by  the  company 
till the year 2008.

Part  of  the  planned investment will be  earmarked  for  a  new 
refrigerator  plant  at  the  company's  sprawling  manufacturing 
complex  on the national capital's outskirts. the decision to  go 
ahead  with  a plant to manufacture fridges was  taken  in  Korea 
following  a report by a company study group which visited  India 
in March last year.

The  report  had asked LG to go in for the  production  of  fully 
automatic  washing machines and frost-free refrigerators. Such  a 
step  would help close the price gap with Indian  companies  like 
BPL and Videocon whose final products are cheaper as they  source 
components indigenously. The proposed plant will have an  initial 
installed  capacity of two lakhs, said senior LG  officials  here 
today.

The  company will also spend a substantial sum while taking  over 
the monitor business under its umbrella. The company has targeted 
an  initial  turnover of Rs. 200 crores and anticipates  a  clear 
leadership by the year end.
