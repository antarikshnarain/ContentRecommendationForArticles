Judge defers hearing in Sharif case 


KARACHI,  JAN. 18. The judge hearing the case against the  ousted 
Pakistani Prime Minister, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, today delayed for one 
day a decision on whether formal charges can be laid even  though 
the  prosecution  has  not handed over key  evidence.  The  anti-
terrorism  court  judge,  Mr. Justice Rehmat  Husain  Jafri,  had 
earlier said he would make a decision by 2.30 p.m. today.

Mr.  Sharif,  his brother, Mr. Shahbaz Sharif,  and  five  former 
aides  are  accused  of criminal  conspiracy,  attempted  murder, 
waging  war  against Pakistan and hijacking - which can  carry  a 
death sentence.

The  case  has dragged on in the courts for  two  months  without 
formal  charges  being laid, and on Tuesday,  Mr.  Justice  Jafri 
ordered  the prosecution to take one of the lawyers  representing 
the  defence to Karachi airport to witness the copying  of  tapes 
made  in  the  air  control  tower on  the  day  of  the  alleged 
hijacking.

The  chief  prosecutor,  Mr. Raja Qureshi,  told  the  court  the 
copying  of the tapes would take time and that the laying of  the 
charges  did not have to wait until all the evidence  was  handed 
over,  while the defence argued that a delay was  needed  because 
the tapes were so important.

``The  recordings  are  of  prime  importance  and  unless  these 
cassettes  are provided to the accused the charges should not  be 
framed,'' Mr. Khwaja Sultan, one of the defence lawyers, told the 
court.

Copies of some air traffic control tapes were made on Monday  but 
defence  lawyers  said another 34 hours of recordings had  to  be 
copied before the trial could go ahead.

``The  defence  should not be taken by surprise so  we  need  the 
recording,'' Mr. Aftab Farrukh, another defence lawyer, told  the 
court.  ``It  should be authenticated so there is  no  chance  of 
tampering.''  But  prosecutors insisted the case  was  ready  for 
trial.
