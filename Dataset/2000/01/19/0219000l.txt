Parties likely to go it alone in Manipur


By Our Correspondent

IMPHAL, JAN. 18. The attempt by the political parties in  Manipur 
to form two fronts ahead of the February elections seems to be an 
exercise in futility since most parties do not see eye to eye  on 
seat adjustment. 

For  the same reason, no such fronts could be formed  during  the 
parliamentary  elections  last year. No  understanding  could  be 
reached  even  among  coalition  partners  of  the  United  Front 
Ministry,  headed by Mr. Wahengram Nipamacha. The parties had  to 
field their own candidates for the two parliamentary seats.

Elections  to the 60-member legislative Assembly will be held  on 
February 12 and 22. 

The ruling party, the Manipur State Congress Party (MSCP), in its 
bid to return to power, has been floating the idea of an alliance 
among  NDA  parties  such as the BJP, the Samata  party  and  the 
Federal Party of Manipur (FPM). There have been several rounds of 
talks  among the leaders of these parties but there has  been  no 
progress since each party is against surrendering any seat. 

The  MSCP  is planning to contest all the 60 seats, but  the  BJP 
national  secretary  in  charge of the border  States,  Mr.  P.B. 
Acharya,  told  reporters that if the MSCP was against  any  seat 
adjustment,  the Minister of State for Sports, Youth Affairs  and 
Welfare Mr. Thounaojam Chaoba, the working president of the MSCP, 
should quit the Union Ministry. 

The  State  BNP president, Mr. Haobam Bhuban, wants the  MSCP  to 
contest from the Singjamei constituency, but the sitting MLA  and 
Cabinet  Minister, Mr. I. Hemochandra, says there is no  question 
of denying tickets to sitting MLAs. 

Moreover,  the  FPM has practically broken away from the  NDA  by 
announcing  a list of 34 candidates. This is the first  list  and 
indications are that the remaining names would be announced  soon 
since the party plans to contest all the seats.
