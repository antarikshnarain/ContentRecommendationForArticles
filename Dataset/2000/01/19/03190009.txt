Grozny stormed again


By Vladimir Radyuhin

MOSCOW, JAN. 18. Russian forces launched a decisive onslaught  on 
the rebel-held Chechen capital of Grozny today, with the  miliary 
vowing to capture the city in the next two-three days.

The  Itar-Tass  news  agency quoted  the  Russian  Army  regional 
headquarters   as  saying  that  troops,  advancing  from   three 
directions, had pushed as far as the city centre. For their part, 
Chechens  denied that Russians had made any gains in Grozny,  the 
last rebel stronghold in lowland Chechnya.

However,  Itar-Tass  reported  that  the  rebels  were   offering 
``fierce  resistance''  to the Russian assault.  Sources  in  the 
Russian headquarters there told the AVN military news agency that 
nevertheless, commanders planned to take Grozny in two days.

Russian  forces  launched  their first big push  on  the  Chechen 
capital  on  Dec. 25, promising to capture the city  by  the  New 
Year.

The Chechens' Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr. Aslanbek Ismailov,  told 
Interfax that the Russians had been heavily shelling Grozny,  but 
have indeed failed to win a new foothold in the city.

The  Russian Defence Ministry said eight federal troops had  been 
killed  and 12 wounded in the past 24 hours there.  It  estimated 
rebel losses at 60 militants. Russians estimate that 2,000  well-
armed rebels are still entrenched in the city.

The Kremlin appears anxious to break organised Chechen resistance 
early  in order to pre-empt reprisal from the new  Russian  Duma, 
which  went into session on Tuesday, and expected accusations  of 
military incompetetence in dealing with the breakaway republic.
