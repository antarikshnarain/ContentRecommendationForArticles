MP Governor refutes Cong(I) charge


By Our Staff Correspondent

BHOPAL,  JAN. 18. The Madhya Pradesh Governor, Dr. Bhai  Mahavir, 
today  refused  to conduct a head count of the  Bhopal  Municipal 
Corporation  (BMC)  members  produced before  him  by  the  local 
Congress(I) leaders and expressed anguish over the charge that he 
was acting in a partisan manner over the recent issue linked with 
the BMC Speaker's election and the BJP corporators' thrashing  by 
the police during the election. 

The  Governor took exception to the projection through a  section 
of the media that he was not giving appointment to the BMC  Mayor 
and others from the Congress side and said that this was a  false 
and misleading propaganda. He expressed his reservations over the 
dharna  organised  by  the  Congressmen  in  front  of  the  MPCC 
headquarters  yesterday and said that he had  been  unnecessarily 
targeted  over certain remark he had made about the  incident  in 
which  the  ``BJP  corporators, including women  members  of  the 
Council  were bolted inside a room and thrashed'' during the  BMC 
Speaker' election.
