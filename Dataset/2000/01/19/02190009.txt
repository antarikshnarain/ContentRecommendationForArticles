Statutory powers for IRDA by May: Sinha


New  DELHI,  JAN. 18. The Union Finance  Minister,  Mr.  Yashwant 
Sinha,  has  said all formalities for opening  up  the  insurance 
sector for private and foreign investors will be completed by the 
first week of May.

``By  the first week of May all formalities  including  statutory 
powers for the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority  (IRDA) 
will  be completed,'' Mr. Sinha told PTI, adding that  the  first 
private insurance companies would start operating in three to six 
months thereafter.

Asked  why  there was delay in the notification  of  FEMA  (which 
replaces  FERA), Mr. Sinha said there are several  details  which 
needed  to  be worked out including setting up  of  an  appellate 
tribunal as provided in the Bill.

The  Finance Minister did not agree with the view that there  was 
delay  in the notification of FEMA as the Government was keen  to 
notify  it along with Prevention of Money Laundering  Bill  which 
has been referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee.

About public sector insurance companies entering banking  sector, 
he  said there has been some demands and the matter needed to  be 
looked into.

Mr.  Sinha also clarified that the Bharatiya Janata  Party  (BJP) 
has  not  somersaulted  on  its view on the  opening  up  of  the 
insurance  sector. The BJP had always maintained  that  insurance 
sector  should  be opened up to the domestic  private  sector  to 
inject  competition  and  this  was  not  at  variance  with  its 
``Swadeshi'' policy.

As  India  did not have adequate wherewithal to bring  in  latest 
technology and practices in the sector, the Government decided to 
allow foreign equity with a cap of 26 per cent, Mr. Sinha added.
