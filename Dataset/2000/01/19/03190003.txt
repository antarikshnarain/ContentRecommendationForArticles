Jaswant, Talbott begin talks


LONDON, JAN. 18. India and the United States today resumed  their 
talks  to narrow their differences on the Comprehensive Test  Ban 
Treaty,  disarmament and non-proliferation in the run up  to  the 
U.S.  President, Mr. Bill Clinton's visit to New Delhi,  expected 
in March.

The  External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh, and  the  U.S. 
Deputy  Secretary of State, Mr. Strobe Talbott, began their  two-
day  10th  round  of  parleys here in  a  veil  of  secrecy  with 
officials from both sides unwilling to disclose the venue of  the 
talks.

The two leaders had held talks in November last year here  during 
which New Delhi and Washington agreed to intensify their contacts 
at all levels and to lay the foundation of a broad-based  forward 
looking relationship between the two countries.

The  issues  being discussed by them related to  disarmament  and 
non-proliferation with emphasis on the CTBT, the Fissile Material 
Cut-off  Treaty, control over exports of sensitive  products  and 
technologies and defence posture.

The  parleys  coincide with the visit to New Delhi  of  the  U.S. 
Treasury  Secretary,  Mr.  Lawrence Summers, who  handed  over  a 
letter  from Mr. Clinton to the Prime Minister, Mr.  Atal  Behari 
Vajpayee.

Last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane and Pakistan's 
involvement in it might also figure in the two-day dialogue.

The two leaders also may concentrate on reducing tensions between 
India  and  Pakistan  as also other  issues  of  mutual  concern, 
official sources said.
