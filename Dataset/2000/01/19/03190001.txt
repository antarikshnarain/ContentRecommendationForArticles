Masood Azhar weds


MULTAN,  JAN.18.  Masood  Azhar,  one  of  the  three   Pakistani 
militants  freed  by  India to end the hijacking  of  the  Indian 
Airlines  jet, has married in a quiet ceremony, his  father  said 
today.

Azhar returned to his home early this month after his release  in 
exchange  of 155 hostages onboard the hijacked plane at  Kandahar 
in  Afghanistan.  He  married  late  yesterday  at  his  home  in 
Bahawalpur,  in  central  Pakistan, 100 Km  south  of  here,  his 
father, Allah Bakhsh Sabir, said.

``It was a simple ceremony just for a few family members,'' Sabir 
said. Only 12 relatives were present at the ceremony, he said.

 Azhar,  who  has  links  to  the  `Harkat-ul-Mujahideen'  group, 
appeared  in public several times since his release and spoke  at 
an Islamic seminary in Karachi earlier this month, vowing to wage 
a holy war against India.
