Dislocating facts


Sir, - To be a member of the Rajya Sabha, a candidate has to be a 
resident of the State from where he or she wants to be elected by 
the Legislature. 

This  requirement is being subverted by candidates renting  flats 
or  houses in States other than their native place  and  creating 
electricity,  water  and  telephone  bill  records  as  proof  of 
residence.

This  practice, initiated by the Congress, is being  emulated  by 
almost   all   major  parties.  Can  persons  who   begin   their 
parliamentary  career fraudulently be taken seriously  when  they 
moralise to the public and Parliament on several issues?

Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife of the U.S. President, wants to  enter 
the  Senate (like our Rajya Sabha) from New York. She walked  out 
of  the White House in Washington and has taken up  residence  in 
New York. 

The  law requires that a Senate candidate be a true  resident  of 
the  State, from where he or she is contesting, for at least  one 
year; that is why Mrs. Clinton relocated herself even if it means 
separation from her husband, for the time being.
