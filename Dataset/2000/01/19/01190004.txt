Pak. expels Moses


By Amit Baruah

ISLAMABAD,  JAN. 18. Mr. P. Moses, a staffer of the  Indian  High 
Commission  here,  abducted  and arrested  on  false  charges  of 
carrying a ``remote device'' for a bomb on Sunday afternoon,  was 
asked today by Pakistan to leave the country within seven days.

The  announcement  came  24 hours after the  acting  Indian  High 
Commissioner,  Mr.  Sudhir Vyas, had told  Pakistani  authorities 
that  there  was no question of Mr. Moses or  other  unidentified 
staff  members  being ``made available''  for  prosecution  under 
local laws.

Given  the  serious nature of the charge, it is  surprising  that 
Pakistan  did not act earlier to have Mr. Moses removed from  the 
scene.  The  approach  is reflective of the  fact  that  Pakistan 
wanted  to use this pretext for launching a  propaganda  campaign 
against India.

Mr.  Vyas  was summoned again today to the Foreign  Ministry  and 
when he reiterated that Mr. Moses would not be ``made available'' 
for prosecution, a note declaring the Indian staffer persona  non 
grata was handed over to him.

The  acting High Commissioner was informed that since  India  was 
not cooperating with Pakistan, Mr. Moses might be withdrawn  from 
the  mission.  The  charge of his  being  involved  in  terrorist 
activities was made again.

India blamed for blast

The Daily Telegraph reports from Lahore:

Pakistan is blaming Indian intelligence agents for Monday's  bomb 
explosion  which  killed  six persons  in a  bazaar  in  Karachi. 
Officials said the bombing was part of an increasing campaign  by 
India to undermine its neighbour.

No  group  has claimed responsibility but a  senior  official  in 
Islamabad  said:  ``It is most likely to be part of  India's  on-
going campaign of aggression to try to intimidate Pakistan.''
