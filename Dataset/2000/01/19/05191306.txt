Not in public interest


Sir, - The reduction in the interest rate for various post office 
small  savings  schemes is unfortunate. The Finance  Minister  is 
thanked  by industrial leaders obviously for the lower  borrowing 
rate. 

But the expectation of the Minister and his Government that  this 
lower  rate will pave the way for more growth and  employment  is 
illusory; the benefit accruing to society as a whole will be just 
marginal as has been seen from our experience.

On  the contrary, the Government's decision will affect a  larger 
section  of  the middle and lower middle classes  including  non-
pensioned retirees whose only hope are the small savings schemes, 
especially the Post Office Monthly Income Plan, in an era of fly-
by-night financial companies.

Additionally,  many  State  Governments which  benefit  by  these 
schemes will be affected in spite of their share increasing  from 
75  to  80 per cent of the net collections;  for,  small  savings 
investments will come down, thanks to the interest reduction, and 
again people will be tempted to risk their investment in  private 
financial companies for high returns. 

It will be better if the Finance Minister maintains the  existing 
rates to protect the interests of the majority of the  population 
than thinking on pure business terms. This class of population is 
also  like  the agriculture sector for which  the  Government  is 
showing special considerations.
