HC rejects TRAI plan on cellphones


NEW  DELHI, JAN. 18. The Delhi High Court today struck  down  the 
Telecom  Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI)  revenue  sharing 
regulation  of  May  1999  on  inter-connection  charges  between 
service  providers  and `Calling Party Pays' (CPP)  scheme  under 
which incoming calls on cellular phones were proposed to be  made 
free. 

A  Division Bench comprising Mr. Chief Justice S.N.  Variava  and 
Mr.  Justice S.K. Mahajan, which had granted interim stay on  the 
CPP  regime  on October 28, 1999 said, the TRAI has no  power  to 
regulate on inter-connection charges. 

``The  TRAI  cannot  lay down terms  and  conditions  to  service 
providers  on  introduction of telecom service,  installation  of 
equipment,  technology  and regulate in respect  of  the  telecom 
industry,'' the Bench ruled saying that the TRAI's power in  this 
regard  were only ``recommendatory'' and the Government  was  not 
bound  to obey the advice. On the proposal to make  the  incoming 
calls  free on mobile phones, the court said cellular service  in 
the  country  was  introduced in 1994 and  had  been  functioning 
effectively ever since without sharing of revenue by the DoT  and 
the MTNL with the operators. 

There was no ``substance'' in the TRAI argument that there  could 
not  be  effective  operation of  cellular  service  without  the 
sharing  of  revenue by the Government with  the  operators,  the 
court held. 

The court advised the TRAI to devise any other alternative scheme 
in place of CPP with mutual consultation of all parties including 
DoT   and   the  MTNL  and  reminded  the  regulator   that   its 
``adjudicatory''  role  on a dispute  between  service  providers 
could  be invoked only when they fail to arrive at an  accord.
