NCP against review of Constitution


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN. 18. The Nationalist  Congress  Party's  Working 
Committee  today passed two resolutions expressing disquiet  over 
the Centre's proposal to review the Constitution and the  Gujarat 
Government's  decision to allow its servants to take part in  RSS 
activities.

Urging  the Prime Minister to persuade the Gujarat Government  to 
withdraw  its circular, the resolution said the move was part  of 
an emerging pattern to saffronise the body politic.

The  Vajpayee  Government's  proposal to set up  a  committee  to 
review  the  Constitution  virtually amounted to  a  contempt  of 
Parliament,  Mr.  Devendra  Dwivedi, NCP  general  secretary  and 
spokesman, said. Only Parliament could amend the Constitution and 
the  appointment of a government committee in derogation  of  the 
House was unprecedented in the annals of democracy.

The  Government  had  not consulted Opposition  parties  and  the 
decision was inherently flawed, based on false premises and  made 
without  an  application  of the mind,  he  said.  ``The  BJP-led 
Government  wants  to  abrogate  the  Constitution  rather   than 
celebrate  its  golden jubilee.'' The belief that  it  needed  an 
overhauling   reflected   a  mindset  which  never   derived   an 
inspiration from the freedom movement.

The  NCP decided to take the lead in contacting other  Opposition 
parties  to evolve a common strategy to counter the move. At  the 
same  time,  it  urged the government  to  drop  the  ill-advised 
proposal.

The  working  committee, which met here, also  discussed  on  the 
strategy  for the Assembly elections and decided to  decentralise 
the  ticket  distribution  process.  According  to  Mr.  Dwivedi, 
informal  talks  are on with the CPI, the JMM and  the  Samajwadi 
Party.
