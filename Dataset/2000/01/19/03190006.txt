Respect Panchsheel, China tells India


BEIJING,  JAN.  18. China today hoped that  India  would  ``fully 
respect'' and ``implement'' the principles of Panchsheel, guiding 
the  Sino- India relations, while dealing with the  17th  Karmapa 
Lama issue.

``We  hope the Indian side would handle this issue in  accordance 
with   the  principles  of  Panchsheel,''  the   Foreign   Office 
spokesman, Mr. Zhu Bangzao, said when asked at a press conference 
about  the  Chinese  stand on the fleeing  of  the  14-year-  old 
Karmapa,  Ugyen  Trinley Dorji, from Tibet to India.  ``The  non-
interference  in  each  others internal affairs  is  one  of  the 
principles.  We hope that this principle be fully  respected  and 
implemented  in  the development of relations between  China  and 
India,''  he  said.  However, he did not say  whether  China  has 
responded  to India's request for more information on the  Lama's 
escape from Tibet.

Last  Friday,  India  had called in the  Chinese  Ambassador  and 
requested  details  from Beijing regarding the departure  of  the 
17th Karmapa Lama.
