Vijayalakshmi prevails over Qin Kanying 


By Rakesh Rao

UDAIPUR,  JAN.  18. Banking on patience and riding her  luck,  S. 
Vijayalakshmi pulled off a spectacular victory over top seed  Qin 
Kanying  in the eighth round of the Asian chess  championship  at 
the CIE complex here on Tuesday. 

Fourth-seeded Vijayalakshmi's seven-hour effort overshadowed some 
creditable  showings  by  her younger  teammates.  Surya  Shekhar 
Ganguly did enough to ensure his second International Master norm 
and K. Sasikiran kept alive his theoretical chances of making the 
Grandmaster  title-requirements  here  while  an  untitled  Tania 
Sachdev  stunned  eighth seeded Kazakh WIM  Tatiana  Sargeeva  to 
brighten  up the proceedings after Bhagyashree Thipsay  had  lost 
from a winning match on the second board.

In  a topsy-turvy battle spread over 90 moves, Vijayalakshmi  won 
an exchange for a pawn in the middle-game of English Opening  but 
lost two more pawns to face a losing position before rallying  to 
reach  the same colour bishop ending with a pawn-advantage.  With 
Kanying  threatening  to  force a draw by  repetition  of  moves, 
Vijayalakshmi produced her better end-game skills to survive  the 
second time-control and won. 

Earlier,  Sasikiran  had  to work all the way to  down  Uzbek  GM 
Saydalli Yuldashev in 61 moves of Kings Indian Defence.  Enjoying 
a  positional edge from the very beginning, Sasikiran  maintained 
the advantage after the exchange of major pieces. Though an equal 
ending was reached with both players having a bishop and a knight 
each,  Sasikiran cashed in on the better placement of his  pieces 
to earn a big point. 

With  five points, Sasikiran is just half a point away  from  his 
Wednesday's top-board rival Zhang Zhong, who shares the lead with 
Chinese  teammates Peng Xiomin, Xu Jun and Vietnamese  Dao  Thien 
Hai. Now Sasikiran should either keep winning to annex the  title 
which  comes  with a GM norm or score enough to  meet  the  norm-
requirements. The task ahead is an arduous one but certainly  not 
beyond the capabilities of the Indian. 

Ganguly,  clearly  the best Indian on view so  far,  reached  4.5 
points needed to make a nine-game IM norm, with a round to spare. 
Irrespective of the result against Bangladesh's IM Ziaur  Rehman, 
Ganguly  is certain to make the norm. But Ganguly will be  aiming 
to do better since he is still on course of a maiden GM norm. 

Harikrishna  is  the  other player who is  well  within  striking 
distance  of the IM norm. He, too, has 4.5 points but  enjoyed  a 
bye in the fourth round. That means, one will have to wait  until 
the  end  of  the 10th round to see whether he  meets  the  norm-
requirments.  

Meanwhile,  younger  girls like Koneru Humpy  and  Tania  Sachdev 
defeated  experienced rivals to garner an important point.  Humpy 
extricated  herself  from  an inferior  position  to  score  over 
seventh seeded Swati Ghate, who blundered a minor piece in  time- 
pressure. Tania survived time-pressure to complete a  comfortable 
victory over Tatiana. 

Bhagyashree  was  only  herself  to blame  for  tossing  away  an 
overwhelmingly  winning  position against Vietnam's  Hoang  Thanh 
Trang, and with it, the chance to complete her Woman  Grandmaster 
title requirements here.
