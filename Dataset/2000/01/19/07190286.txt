Lankan spinners stifle England 


By Sanjay Rajan

COLOMBO,  JAN.  18. His words still ring in one's  ears.  At  the 
start  of  the Youth cricket World Cup here a week ago,  the  Sri 
Lankan captain Malintha Gajanayake said he believed this was  the 
best chance for his country to win the Cup. ``I fancy it will  be 
either  Pakistan, India or us, owing to our familiarity with  the 
conditions.  Moreover,  the  three  of us  have  very  good  spin 
attacks. Ours is penetrative.''

At  the  Saravanamuthu Stadium here on Tuesday,  the  Sri  Lankan 
spinners  stifled  reigning champion England into  submission  in 
their opening Group II Super-League encounter.

On a square that offered bounce, England was initially dismantled 
by  the  lively  mediumpacer Prabath Nissanka,  who  knocked  Ian 
Bell's  off-stump  back  in the opening over of the  day  with  a 
delivery  that moved away. Three overs later he  surprised  left-
hander Adams with his bounce to have him held at short-leg.

From six for two, left-handers Mark Wallace and Michael  Carberry 
took  the  score  to 62 by the 20th  over  with  some  determined 
batting but none really dominating. 

Sri Lanka introduced spin in the 13th over. The English lads, who 
didn't quite use their feet, were also troubled by the bounce the 
spinners  gained.  Off-spinner Pushpakumara  broke  the  Wallace-
Carberry stand when he drew out the latter to have him stumped by 
yards. Left-arm spinner Dhammika, who on occasions spun the  ball 
across  the face of the bat, had Phillips and Wallace leg  before 
in successive overs. 

Southpaw  Pratt  and Alex Loudon hung around for 37  runs  before 
Gajanayake,  leading by example, swooped down from the covers  to 
run  out the latter while mediumpacer Weeraratne, in  his  second 
spell,  had the former driving away and into the cover  fielder's 
hands. Following this was a collapse which the reigning  champion 
never quite recovered from.

Sri Lanka won the contest by seven wickets with plently to spare. 
Opener  Ian Daniel looks to be a very compact player while  left-
hander Jehan Mubarak is certainly a clean striker of the ball.

Easy outing for India 

Joint favourite India put it across surprise entrant Nepal easily 
by  eight  wickets  in the other Group  II  encounter  which  was 
shifted  from Katunayake (wet ground condition) to  Police  Park, 
the delay causing the encounter to be reduced to 44 overs a side. 

Left-arm   spinner  Yuveraj  Singh  came  up  with   his   second  
consecutive  four-wicket haul while skipper Md. Kaif  notched  up 
his maiden half century of the competition. 

Aussies put skids on West Indies

In  the Super-League Group I, strong contender Australia put  the 
skids on West Indies' winning spree at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 
West  Indies, undefeated thus far, was restrcited to 199 for  six 
in the allotted 50 overs. Marlon Samuels made a half century.  In 
reply,  Australia knocked up with required runs with six  wickets 
in  hand and 1.1 overs to spare. Shane Watson led the way with  a 
neat 72.

Saeed rips through Kiwis

Pakistan  defeated last edition's runner- up New Zealand  by  six 
wickets  in the other SL Group I match at the Premadasa  Stadium. 
Its  hero was Zahid Saeed who took five for 14 in 8.3 overs.  New 
Zealand was seven for four at one stage. 

The  Plate  championship first round matches will  be  played  on 
Wednesday while the second round of the Super-League will be held 
on Thursday.
