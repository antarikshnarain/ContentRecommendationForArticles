Serena struggles, Pioline stumbles at first hurdle


By Nirmal Shekar

MELBOURNE,  JAN.  18. He is a champion nobody cares about  -  and 
watching him on court, furiously wiping the sweat off a  four-day 
stubble  and, now and again, gingerly moving from end to  end  on 
the baseline, his contorted sun-kissed face reflecting a  mixture 
of  pain and dismay, you get the feeling that Yevgeny  Kafelnikov 
himself  cares  little  about whether he continues  to  remain  a 
champion or not.

In  fact, there are times when you get the distinct feeling  that 
the  Russian, the defending champion here and seeded No. 2,  will 
actually feel relieved, rather than be devastated, should someone 
unburden  him  of  the  load he  is  carrying  with  considerable 
uneasiness - a Grand Slam title.

On Tuesday, his balding German opponent, Jens Knippschild, failed 
to oblige the champion, although the man from Arolsen did promise 
much in taking the first set from a hobbled, wobbly and  woefully 
off-form  Kafelnikov before the Russian, braving a  groin  muscle 
injury  which he says is not serious, went through to the  second 
round, winning 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.

On a day when the red carpet was rolled out for the king and  the 
queen in the Rod Laver Arena, this was a match few seemed to care 
about,  going by the number of seats that  weren't  taken...until 
the queen walked in, of course.

For,  when Martina Hingis made her way to the court after a  rain 
delay,  the  contrast  was stunning - not only in  terms  of  the 
reception she was accorded but, more importantly, for the  manner 
in which she dismissed her former doubles partner, Mirjana Lucic, 
6-1,  6-2 in 43 minutes in the first round on a court  where  she 
hasn't been beaten since 1996.

If  Hingis  has the demeanour of a champion who owns  the  stage, 
then  Kafelnikov hardly looks the part. His shoulders seem to  be 
sagging  under the crown and he looks like a bedraggled  commoner 
who has intruded accidentally into the realm of royalty.

Of course, the no-nonsense Russian clearly let us know last  year 
that  he  might have just chanced upon the title, thanks  to  the 
absence  of  Pete Sampras, the man Kafelnikov  thanked  for  `not 
coming' in 1999.

Knippschild had a bit of a problem as he had his left ankle taped 
early in the fourth set. But the biggest problem was faced by the 
ones  in  the stands - it might have taken enormous  patience  to 
have sat through the whole match.

If  winning ugly may have suited Kafelnikov - who did  everything  
he  could  to lose ugly at the Gold Flake Open  in  Chennai  last 
fortnight  -  then it must be said that the  three-time  champion 
Hingis's brilliance in the same arena later in the afternoon came 
as some compensation for the spectators.

Surely, this wasn't a match that Lucic would care to remember for 
a long time - in fact, not even until tomorrow morning. But  that 
should not take away from the quality of Hingis's tennis and  her 
athleticism on court.

While  Hingis looks fitter than ever before in her  career,  then 
Lucic,  who did so well at Wimbledon last year when she made  the 
semifinals  and lost to Steffi Graf in a memorable  three-setter, 
is  now  carrying a little - perhaps more than  little  -  excess 
baggage.

While  it  would be unwise and uncharitable too to  call  Richard 
Krajicek to comment on the issue - the Dutchman said a few  years 
ago at Wimbledon that many women players were `fat pigs' -  Lucic 
certainly has put on a few kilos in the recent months.

Even  if you happen to own a body like Steffi Graf's and  perhaps 
75  per  cent of the great lady's game too, it would  still  take 
some  effort  to get past the Swiss Miss in Melbourne  Park.  But 
what  Lucic  brought with her today were  credentials  that  were 
hardly enough to let her stay in the royal presence of Hingis for 
three quarters of an hour.

Lucic  won a total of 29 points in the match, but a good many  of 
them  came in the second set. For, through the first five  games, 
the  Croatian had struggled to win six points. In the event,  she 
was almost ecstatic when she held serve to 1-5 in the first set.

Hingis,  for her part, was having fun out there. She even  played 
serve-and-volley points for a change. After allowing her opponent 
just enough time to do a bit of face-saving work, Hingis ran away 
with the match from 2-2 in the second set.

One of Hingis's biggest challengers for the title, the U.S.  Open 
champion and third seed, Serena Williams, was given a  horrendous 
scare  by  Amanda Grahame, an Australian ranked 261 who  found  a 
place  in  the  main  draw courtesy  a  wild  card.  Serena,  who 
struggled the keep balls in play, finally fought her way to a  6- 
4, 4-6, 6-4 first round victory in a night match.

Meanwhile,  Goran Ivanisevic's 6-4, 2-6, 7-5, 1-6, 9-7 defeat  of 
Cedric Pioline, seeded 13, was not much of a surprise. But, then, 
nothing that Goran does, or does not do, is much of a surprise.

The  unpredictable Croatian finished outside the top 20  for  the 
first  time in a decade last year - he was No. 62 at the  end  of 
1999 - but on courts that are playing really fast here this year, 
he  can go some distance if he continues to serve as well  as  he 
did today when he fired 32 aces.

Other men's seeds going out during the day were the former French 
champion  Gustavo  Kuerten of Brazil, seeded five, and  the  15th 
seeded Spaniard Albert Costa.

Albert Portas of Spain came back from the brink - he was down two 
sets  and 2-4 in the third - to get past Kuerten, staving  off  a 
pair  of matchpoints in the fourth set for a 4-6, 4- 6,  6-4  7-6 
(8-6),  6-4 victory while Christophe Rochus of Belgium  got  past 
Albert Costa 6-3, 6-7 (8-6), 6-4, 6-3. 

Later in the evening, promising Swiss Davis Cupper Roger  Federer 
got  past Michael Chang, a former world No.2 and a finalist  here 
in  1996,  6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) and Nicolas Lapentti  of  Ecuador, 
seeded  seven, battled back from fatigue and a break down in  the 
fourth set to beat Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine 6-3, 5- 7, 6-7,  6-
4, 8-6.

Paes-Lareau seeded No. 1

India's  Leander  Paes, the world's top doubles player,  and  his 
Canadian  partner Sebastien Lareau have been seeded No. 1 in  the 
doubles event of the championship. The pair will meet Geoff Grant 
and  Jack  Waite of the United States in the  first  round.  Todd 
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde are seeded to meet Paes and  Lareau 
in the final.
