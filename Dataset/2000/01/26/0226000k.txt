Sabotage suspected in Rajdhani goof-up


GUWAHATI,  JAN.  25. The Northeast Frontier  Railway  today  said 
there  was  a ``strong possibility'' of sabotage in  setting  the 
Guwahati-bound  Rajdhani  Express on the down line on  which  the 
Delhi-bound Avadh-Assam Express was stationary, about 10 km  away 
in north Bengal on Monday.

``Involvement  of  an  outside agency in  forcibly  altering  the 
position of the turnout (device to change the route) is a  strong 
possibility,'' a NF Railway statement said here.

Enquiry  showed  that  while the position of  the  route  in  the 
signalling  cabin  indicated that the train would go  in  the  up 
line, the situation on the ground was that the train was going on 
the  down  line  ``which  cannot  happen  as  per  the   existing 
interlocking arrangements,'' it said.

However,  the railways clarified that while the Rajdhani  Express 
was just leaving Kumedpur, the Avadh Assam Express was stationary 
at Khurial station, about 10 km away from Kumedpur.

The driver of the Rajdhani Express noticed the goof-up and  since 
the train was at a slow speed, he could stop it within the limits 
of  Kumedpur station, it said.Earlier in August last year,  about 
over  280  passengers  were killed and scores  injured  when  the 
Avadh-Assam  express  and  the Brahmaputra  Mail  collided  after 
coming  on same track at gaisal, near Malda in north Bengal.  Ms. 
Mamata Banerjee, now Railway Minister, had at that time said that 
she  had  strong suspicion that the Gaisal accident  was  due  to 
sabotage.

According  to reports received from Jalpaiguri,  security  checks 
have been intensified on all long-distance trains passing through 
north  Bengal. Checks are being carried on with sniffer dogs  and 
metal detectors.
