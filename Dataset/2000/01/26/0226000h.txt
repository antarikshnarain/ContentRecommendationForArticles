Power strike may end today


NEW DELHI, JAN. 25. The 11-day strike by the workers of the Uttar 
Pradesh  State Electricity Board (UPSEB) is likely to  end  today 
with  striking  leaders accepting the notification of  the  State 
Government  for  trifurcation  of  the  board,  the  Union  Power 
Minister, Mr. P.R. Kumaramangalam, said today.

``The  final  round  of negotiations will be  held  today  and  I 
believe  that  the  striking employees have  accepted  the  UPSEB 
notification,'' he said here.

Meanwhile, highly placed Power Ministry officials told PTI on the 
condition  on  anonymity  that about  20,000  workers,  including 
engineers, had already joined work on Monday.

In a note to the Cabinet Secretary, Mr. Prabhat Kumar, the  Power 
Ministry said that it was their understanding that ``the striking 
leaders  are  worn  out and have accepted as  fait  accompli  the 
notification trifurcating the UPSEB.''
