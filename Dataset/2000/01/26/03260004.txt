Hijackers had Pak. backing: report


NEW  YORK, JAN. 25. The United States believes that  a  terrorist 
group supported by the Pakistani military was responsible for the 
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last month, Monday's New York 
Times reports, quoting Clinton administration officials. 

The   judgment  puts  Pakistan  at  risk  of  being   placed   on 
Washington's list of nations that support terrorism, according to 
the  unnamed  officials,  the  paper  said.  The  Pakistan  Chief 
Executive,  Gen.  Pervez Musharraf, was asked in a  meeting  with 
three administration officials in Islamabad last week to ban  the 
group,  the  Harkat-ul-Mujahideen  (HUM),  but  the  request  was 
rebuffed,  senior  officials in Washington  said.  Administration 
officials  said  they  received  information  that  the  HUM  was 
responsible  for the hijacking after it became clearer  who  made 
the arrangements for the escape of the hijackers.

``Indications  came  through intelligence channels, and  I  don't 
know anybody around here, including the skeptics, who don't  find 
that credible,'' an official was quoted as saying about the HUM's 
involvement in the hijacking.
