dated January 26, 1950: Birth of a Republic


The  inauguration  of the Republic of India was an  act  of  high 
faith  in the people of this country, a gesture of dedication  of 
all  the  nation's  talent and resources to  the  realisation  of 
worthy  purpose.  On  the duties and  responsibilities  of  every 
Indian, the day's Editorial said:

``Every  citizen must remember that if matters go wrong with  the 
State  it  is  he  that  is  ultimately  responsible.  He   must, 
therefore, not only acquire by study, enough familiarity with the 
working  of the machinery of Government through  which  democracy 
functions. He must understand the basic problems which have to be 
tackled if the good life is to be realised here and now. He  must 
have  the  strength of character which alone is a  nation's  true 
capital. And above all he must have the will to put his  shoulder 
to  the wheel and push and pull, never getting out of  step  with 
his  fellows, never seeking short cuts, never succumbing  to  the 
temptation to find scapegoats...

``The Puranic legends of Creation speak of the Virat lying  prone 
on  the  face of the waters, unresponsive to any  of  the  lesser 
powers that entered, until at last the Supreme Spirit entered and 
forthwith the Virat moved. We may regard that as a parable of our 
present  political situation. The Republic of Weimar drew  up  an 
admirable  Constitution  which  became waste  paper  because  the 
Republic  had no fire in its belly. It is that fire, that  energy 
of life, that must be roused in the dormant consciousness of  the 
people  if  India  is to build up a fair,  equitable  and  viable 
polity and a full life for her millions.''
