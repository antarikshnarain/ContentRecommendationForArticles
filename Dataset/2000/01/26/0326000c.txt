Wahid holds talks with Aceh leaders


By P. S. Suryanarayana

SINGAPORE,  JAN.  25. The Indonesian President,  Mr.  Abdurrahman 
Wahid,  today  sought  to  bring a  healing  touch  to  the  Aceh 
province, the theatre of a separatist struggle, by travelling  to 
the  region  and  holding talks with the  local  authorities  and 
representatives. He also unveiled a proposal for a ``free  port'' 
in the area to boost the economic prospects of the people there.

The  enormity  of the President's agenda was underscored  by  the 
clashes  that occurred on the eve of his visit to  Aceh.  Several 
separatist militants and security personnel were reported  killed 
in those incidents.

At another level, the Vice-President, Ms. Megawati  Sukarnoputri, 
continued her peace mission to the riot-ravaged Spice Isles for a 
second straight day. Overnight, her convoy was briefly held up at 
a  point by some people affected by the communal  carnage  there, 
but  there  was no disruption of her visit itself.  On  the  East 
Timorese  front, a clash was reported at a market place  in  Dili 
today, but the U.N.-mandated security forces moved in to  restore 
order.
