Rivaldo, world's best player 


BRUSSELS,  JAN.  25. Rivaldo, newly crowned as the  world's  best 
soccer player of 1999, does not plan to rest on his laurels.

``Now I want to be European champion with Barcelona, then play in 
the  2002 World Cup and win that for Brazil,'' the man  with  the 
explosive left foot told reporters after lifting the FIFA  player 
of the year award on Monday night.

Big  ambitions,  but few doubt Rivaldo has the drive  to  achieve 
them.

The  poor  boy  from Brazil's arid  northeast  has  overcome  the 
criticism  that rained upon him after his team's 1998  World  Cup 
defeat  and, at 27, matured into an attacking midfielder who  has 
it all - blistering pace, subtle ball control and a lethal  goal-
scoring instinct.

Coaches of 140 national teams overwhelmingly selected Rivaldo  as 
the best in the game, ahead of Manchester United's pinpoint  pass 
master  David  Beckham and  Fiorentina's  Argentine  sharpshooter 
Gabriel Batistuta.

In the worldwide poll, Rivaldo won 91 first place votes, compared 
to  Beckham's 18 and Batistuta's five. The big striker  with  the 
beaming smile choked back the emotion as he was awarded the prize 
at a gala evening in Brussels.

``I  don't have words to express this,'' he told reporters  after 
the  ceremony. ``This is for my family, for everybody who  helped 
me. It's for the whole of Brazil.'' - AP
