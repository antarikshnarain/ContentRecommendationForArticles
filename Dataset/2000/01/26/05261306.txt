Sri Lankan politics


Sir,  -  Mr. A. P. Venkateswaran's article, ``Civil  war  in  Sri 
Lanka'' (TheHindu, Jan. 21), has not only failed to point out how 
the  present  regime or, for that matter, even  the  earlier  one 
reduced  Sri  Lankan Tamils to `second class' citizens  but  also 
indirectly pleaded for dismemberment of the island.

During  the  1994 Presidential and  Parliamentary  elections  the 
Tamils voted overwhelmingly for Ms. Chandrika Kumaratunga. But in 
the  Presidential  election held in December last  they  switched 
loyalty  to  the United National Party. All  indications  of  the 
shift  were already available, starting with the victory  of  the 
UNP's Mr. Karu Jayasuriya in the Colombo Mayoral elections,  held 
a  few years ago, with massive Tamil support. This suggests  that 
the Tamils have their own feel of the local politics and the less 
our Venkateswarans interfere with their intelligence, the  better 
for them.

The  devolution  packages  that Ms.  Kumaratunga  presented  were 
largely  crafted  by the late Neelan Tiruchelvam, a TULF  MP  and 
human rights activist. That they did not get through is a complex 
story.

About  Buddhism, it must be underlined that this aspect is  often 
overemphasised.  The importance given to any particular  religion 
in a democracy is anachronistic, yet the problem in Sri Lanka  is 
not  religious  as such. When Buddhism was  once  again  accorded 
primacy in the draft Constitution presented by Ms. Kumaratunga in 
1997, there was no objection from either Hindu religious  leaders 
or the Sri Lankan Tamils in general. Incidentally, since the 10th 
century  A.D., Lord Buddha has been one of the Hindu avatars  and 
both  Hindu and Buddhist shrines are frequented by the  Buddhists 
and  Hindus  alike.  About  Sir  Hugh  Cleghorn's  despatch,  Mr. 
Venkateswaran  had  better read more about  Sri  Lanka's  history 
before putting him on a pedestal he little deserves.
