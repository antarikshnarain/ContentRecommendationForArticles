Cong.-NCP panel to draft common minimum plan 


By Our Special Correspondent

MUMBAI, JAN. 25. The ruling Congress(I)-NCP front in  Maharashtra 
has formed a committee to prepare a common minimum programme  for 
the Deshmukh Government.

The  committee would be headed by the president of  the  Peasants 
and Workers Party, Prof. N.D. Patil. The State presidents of  all 
front constituents would be members of the committee, which would 
submit its report to the Chief Minister within a fortnight. 

This  was  decided  at  a meeting  of  the  Front's  coordination 
committee  held here on Monday. This was the first  such  meeting 
since the swearing in of the front Government about 100 days ago. 

Several    leaders   appealed   for   implementation    of    the 
recommendations  of  the Srikrishna Commission and  the  Gundewar 
Commission reports. While the former had inquired into the Mumbai 
riots and serial blasts, the latter had probed the police  firing 
at Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar.
