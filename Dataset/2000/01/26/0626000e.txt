Govt. needs to take bold steps


THE  performance of the Indian economy over the last  four  years 
has  remained  considerably  below  its  potential  as  well   as 
expectations generated by the initial successes of the new policy 
regime.  Both internal and external factors have  contributed  to 
the slow down. While the East Asian currency crisis has had  some 
direct impact on the Indian economy its indirect effect has  been 
more  pronounced due to the marked slow down of the world  trade. 
Wide  ranging  sanctions against India in response  to  it  going 
nuclear  in April 1998 have also inflicted some short run  damage 
to the economy.

It is noteworthy that despite a hostile economic and  noneconomic 
environment the annual rate of growth of real GDP has, except  in 
1997-98,  remained near or above the 6 per cent mark.  Even  more 
strikingly, the fact that the economy has survived the  sanctions 
and other tribulations over the last year indicates a measure  of 
its resilience and robustness. This notwithstanding, it would  be 
misleading  to overlook two things. First, the  revised  national 
accounts  statistics  with  base 1993-94 have  not  only  yielded 
higher real as well as nominal magnitudes of GDP but also  higher 
rates of growth. The fact that rates of growth calculated on  the 
old  and  the  new data sets are not  comparable  should  not  be 
missed.  Second, given that the performance of  the  agricultural 
sector is more or less exogenous in the short and the medium  run 
and, that the services sector has its own momentum of growth,  it 
is the rate of growth of the industrial sector which is a  better 
measure  of  the pulse of the economy, than that of  the  overall 
GDP.  Going by this the Indian economy has markedly  slowed  down 
since  1995- 96 when the industrial sector grew by nearly 13  per 
cent.  In  fact, an acceleration in industrial  growth  over  the 
three years, 1993-94 through 1995-96 had given rise to hopes that 
the  economy  was set to move along the steeper  segment  of  the 
celebrated J-curve. This was clearly premature.

In  many  ways 1996-97 has been a turning point  for  the  Indian 
economy. Industrial growth declined sharply to about 6 per  cent, 
half  of what it was in the preceding year. It remained at  about 
that  level  in 1996- 97 also. However, a spectacular  growth  in 
agriculture, exceeding 9 per cent, helped the overall real GDP to 
increase by a little less than 8 per cent. But with  agricultural 
growth nosediving to minus 5.6 per cent in 1997-98 and industrial 
growth of only about 6.6 per cent the overall GDP growth declined 
to 5 per cent.

Inflation  measured by WPI showed some deceleration from about  8 
per cent in 1995-96 to about 6.5 per cent in 1996-97 and 4.8  per 
cent  in  1997-98.  But going by CPI the rate  of  inflation  has 
remained high. It was 9.4 per cent in 1996-97 and 6.8 per cent in 
1997-98. Increase in trade flows also decelerated dramatically in 
1996-97  and  1997-98.  In  both years  export  growth  (in  U.S. 
dollars) plummeted to just 5 per cent and import growth (in  U.S.  
dollars)  to  6.1  and  6.7  per  cent  respectively.  A  welcome 
development  on the other hand was a steady deceleration  in  the 
rate of inflation. Measured by the wholesale price index it  went 
down  to 6.4 per cent in 1996-97 and to 4.8 per cent in  1997-98. 
This  was despite the growth rate of M3 accelerating to 16.2  and 
18  per cent over the two years. Another development in the  same 
direction was a continued increase in the foreign currency assets 
to $26.4 and $29.4 billion over the two years.

Let  us  now  turn to the forecasts for  1999-2000  and  the  two 
succeeding years. As mentioned earlier the forecasts are based on 
a   biggish   structural   model   consisting   of   nearly   347 
relationships.   Of   these   211   are   identities,   136   are 
behavioural/technological/linking  equations estimated from  data 
spanning  over  1970-71 through 1994-95. Forecasts  also  involve 
assumptions  on many exogenous variables. These are described  as 
follows.

Forecasts of recovery

Though  the  overall rate of growth has remained fairly  good  in 
absolute  level as well as relative to most other  economies  the 
fiscal  year  1998-99 has been the worst during the  post  reform 
period. By all accounts, however, the economy now appears to have 
come  out of this trough. The recovery is slow but  sure.  During 
the first half of this fiscal (1999-2000) all indicators  compare 
favourably with those for the corresponding period last year. The 
general  index  of  industrial production lead  by  that  of  the 
manufacturing sector is estimated to have increased by 6 per cent 
over the months April through August, 1999 as compared to 4.4 per 
cent for the same period in 1998.

In  overall  terms the summer rains have been normal  though  its 
distribution  over time and space has not been satisfactory.  How 
the  agricultural sector will perform depends now on  the  winter 
rains.  But  even if this is normal the agricultural  sector  may 
only  marginally  cross the heights it attained  last  year.  Our 
forecasts  thus  put  agricultural growth fairly  close  to  zero 
though positive and manufacturing sector growth at about 7.2  per 
cent.  Infrastructure too may show some acceleration  taking  the 
growth rate beyond 7 per cent. Services are shown to grow by more 
than  10 per cent and public administration by 5 per  cent.  This 
gives an overall growth of GDP (at factor cost) as 6.35 per cent. 
It is possible that agriculture performs better than our forecast 
and  services  grow at no more than 8.5 per cent. But  under  all 
alternative  scenarios we expect GDP to grow at or a bit above  6 
per cent in 1999-2000.

Over  the  next  two  years  (2000-01  and  2001-02)  we   expect 
agriculture to more or less return to its medium-long term  trend 
so  as to grow by about 3.1 and 3.4 per cent.  The  manufacturing 
sector growth is unlikely to accelerate significantly growing  by 
only 7.1 and 7.7 per cent. Infrastructures will show some  though 
not a spectacular improvement with rates of growth at 7.9 and 7.6 
per  cent.  Services  growth  decelerates  marginally  and  given  
between  9 and 10 per cent. Value added in public  administration 
grow  below but close to 5 per cent. Thus GDP growth in 2000-  01 
goes up to nearly 7 per cent and in 2001-02 accelerates to  about 
7.3 per cent. It is thus clear that over the next two three years 
the  economy only barely reaches its performance in  1994-95  and 
1995-96 as far as GDP growth is concerned. 

One welcome development which began even during the last  quarter 
of  1998-99  has  been  a steady  deceleration  in  the  rate  of 
inflation.  For the current fiscal the wholesale price  index  of 
agricultural products is forecast to go up by 7 per cent compared 
to nearly 12 per cent in 1998-99. But over the next two years the 
rate  is predicted to accelerate again to about 9.2 and  9.1  per 
cent. The trend in the wholesale price of manufactures follows  a 
moderate acceleration from 4.3 per cent in 1998-99 to 4.5 and 4.7 
over  the current and the next fiscal. The year 2001-02  shows  a 
sharper acceleration to nearly 6 per cent. Thus, we see that  the 
rate  of inflation (WPI) turns out to be about 5.2, 6.4  and  6.9 
per cent over this and the subsequent two years. Fortunately  the 
rate  of inflation measured by the consumer price index does  not 
deviate  from the WPI rate by as much as it has in the past,  The 
implicit GDP deflator also follows closely the movements in WPI. 

The recovery of trade flows in the international economy seems to 
have had salutary effect on India's exports. Exports in terms  of 
U.S.  dollars  which  dipped  by 4.4 per  cent  in  1998-99  have 
recorded an increase of 4.6 per cent during the first five months 
of this fiscal (April-August 1999). In August alone dollar  value 
of  exports by more than 10 per cent. Given this  momentum  total 
exports (in U.S. dollars) for the year as a whole are forecast to 
rise  by  8.9  per  cent for the entire  year,  with  exports  of 
manufactures going up only by about 3.7 per cent. The increase is 
modest  but  very  welcome after a  significant  decline  in  the 
previous year. The next two years are forecast to show a  further 
improvement  with  rates of increase once again  going  into  two 
digits namely, 14.0 in 2000-01 and 12.8 in 2001-02. 

Going by the DGCI&S; data the trade gap in 1998-99 is estimated at 
$8.3 billion. Our forecasts for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 imply  that 
the  trade  gap  will widen to about $10.26  billion  and  $11.08 
billion  respectively.  There appears to be a danger  signal  for 
2001-02  when the gap will widen more steeply to  $16.4  billion. 
According to the RBI data set the current account deficit,  which 
is  estimated  to have been at $6.7 billion in 1998-99  rises  to 
$7.2  billion in 1999-2000 and then decreases moderately to  $6.4 
billion  in  2000-01.  What  it will  be  in  2001-02  is  highly 
speculative  but  our forecast is a bit  disturbing  because  the 
deficit  is likely to increase sharply to $10.3 billion. For  all 
years,  and in variance with several other forecasts the  current 
account deficit will not exceed 2 per cent of GDP.

The  most  disturbing development the last four years or  so  has 
been  growing  fiscal imbalance which had, to  some  extent  been 
achieved under the Congress Government. The gross fiscal  deficit 
(GFD)  of  the  Central government as a ratio of  GDP  at  market  
prices is commonly taken as a measure of this imbalance. However, 
in  our  view  GFD/  GDP ratio does  not  correctly  reflect  the 
imbalance. It is more appropriate to look at the overall resource 
gap  of  the public sector. This is seen to be at about  6.6  per 
cent in 1997-98 and 1998-99 and widening to well over 8 per  cent 
over  this and next two years. The same story is corroborated  by 
the  behaviour  of government final  consumption  expenditure  at 
1980-81 prices. That the rate of growth of this variable in  real 
terms goes beyond 7 per cent over the next two years will  surely 
add  to the imbalances in so far as deficit is more likely to  be 
due to current expenditures rather than public investment.

Policy stance and forecasts: an overview

The emerging scenario for the Indian economy at the start of  the 
twenty  first  century as described above is neither  dismal  nor 
bouyant. It has been drawn on assumptions which are perceived  to 
be pragmatic. It is our best guess that the policy stance of  the 
newly  installed government would be mildly activist. Whether  it 
will  come to grips with the problems that hamper  faster  growth 
consistent  with the country's potential and the  newly  emerging 
expectations is a moot question. 

If it does, in fact, have the will to take hard decisions despite 
the  prevailing political constraints the economic scenario  over 
the next few years could be brighter than the foregoing forecasts 
show.  That  it may also turn out to be the  opposite  cannot  be 
ruled out. But our stakes on that are quite low at the moment.The 
country's poor performance over the last three to four years  may 
have been due to a demand recession. This in turn has been due to 
low  level  of  capital formation, poor  export  performance  and 
inadequate  infrastructure. While poor external  environment  has 
contributed  to this state of affairs the domestic  factors  have 
been equally if not even more important. The new economic  policy 
regime  had  started  with two related  but  distinct  objectives 
namely  stabilisation and structural adjustment. While  no  major 
dent  has been made into the latter success with the  former  has 
been limited.

One  area which should be high on the new government's agenda  is 
the  restoration of fiscal balance of the entire  public  sector. 
This  is  an important precondition for the success  of  whatever 
initiatives  are taken in other areas. Next is the efficiency  of 
the public sector undertakings. 

Since  privatisation is not a solution to all of them reforms  to 
bring  in  some measure of efficiency are  essential.  High  unit 
costs  resulting from inefficiency cannot be indefinitely  passed 
on to the consumers. 

One  major source of persistent inflation does happen to  be  the 
frequent escalation of administered prices. The third priority at 
the moment happens to be the improvement of financial and capital 
markets. Recent data show that some improvement in the working of 
public  sector  banks that had been achieved is  getting  eroded.  
This is indeed very disturbing.

It  is  clear  that in all cases government needs  to  take  bold 
steps. One way to demonstrate this is to get expeditiously passed 
various bills which were tabled in Parliament before the vote  of 
confidence fell in April. Once again it is worth reiterating that 
the  economy could perform better than our forecasts show if  the 
policy  formulation  and  implementation is  taken  up  in  right 
earnest.  It  is important to note that the industrial  world  is 
believed   to   be  undergoing  a  churning  process   aimed   at 
restructuring itself. This may, at least partly, explain  reduced 
investment  and slowing down of output growth in the  short  run. 
For  long run benefits clear policy signals are therefore  needed 
to expedite this process. Sooner the better.
