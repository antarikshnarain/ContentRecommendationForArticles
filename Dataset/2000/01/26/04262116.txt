Mullaperiyar: Nayanar invites Karunanidhi for talks


By Our Special Correspondent

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, JAN. 25. The Kerala Chief Minister, Mr. E. K. 
Nayanar, on Tuesday invited the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Mr. M. 
Karunanidhi,   for   talks   on   the   Mullaperiyar   issue   in 
Thiruvananthapuram.

In  a letter, Mr. Nayanar requested Mr. Karunanidhi to propose  a 
suitable  date  for  the  talks.  Mr.  Nayanar  agreed  with  Mr. 
Karunanidhi's suggestion that the matter should be discussed.

Referring  to Mr. Karunanidhi's comment that the two States  were 
yet to exchange reports of the technical committees on the issue, 
Mr. Nayanar said the committee set up by Kerala had submitted its 
report. He had asked the officials to exchange the reports at the 
earliest. (Both States had set up technical committees to examine 
the  safety  and  other  aspects of the  dam  as  decided  during 
ministerial talks here in August, 1998).

Mr. Nayanar said he was very keen to settle all issues  connected 
to the Mullaperiyar dam. However, there was widespread concern in 
Kerala  over the safety of the existing dam. He hoped to  present 
these concerns at the proposed conference.
