Ricky hits century as India drubs Australia 


By Sanjay Rajan

COLOMBO, JAN. 25. One hour into the match and Australia seemed to 
have   lost  the  battle  in  the  mind.  It  had  expected   the 
mediumpacers   to   prise  out  the  Indian  top-order   at   the 
Saravanamuthu Stadium today.

Its strike bowler Paul Rofe came up with a tidy first spell.  But 
that  was as far as he got, or, the Australians for that  matter, 
as  openers Ravneet Ricky and Manish Sharma forged  their  second 
century-plus stand in the Youth World Cup.

Their  124-run start (in 30.5 overs) formed the base  of  India's 
284,  the  edition's highest total so far,  while  Ravneet  Ricky 
(108,  143b, 14x4), who also has two half centuries to his  name, 
became only the third century-maker after Jacques Rudolph  (South 
Africa) and Shane Watson (Australia) this year.

India's 170-run victory in the semifinal is the biggest margin of 
the tournament, while the side remains the only unbeaten team  in 
the  tournament.  India  meets  Sri Lanka in  the  final  at  the 
Sinhalese Sports Club on January 28.

South  Africa and Bangladesh have entered the Plate  Championship 
final.  In the semifinals today, South Africa  defeated  Zimbabwe 
and Bangladesh beat Ireland.
