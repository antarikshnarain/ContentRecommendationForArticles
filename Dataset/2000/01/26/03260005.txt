'Indian programmers were violating visa status'


WASHINGTON,   JAN.   25.  The  United  States   Immigration   and 
Naturalisation   Service   (INS)  has  said   that   the   Indian 
programmers,  arrested and released on bond at the  Randolph  Air 
Force  base  near  San  Antonio  on  Thursday  were  working   in 
``violation of their non- immigrant visa status.''

The INS believed that the programmers were ``working in violation 
of  their  non-immigrant  visa  status,''  Ms.  Mariela   Malero, 
regional spokeswoman for the INS in Dallas, Texas, said today.

She  also did not rule out sanctions against the  companies  that 
brought them here pending outcome of investigations.

``We  will continue to look into workings of the  company  (which 
brought them). 

That could be the potential for sanctions if we indeed found  the 
company in violation (of visa provisions). Right now, there is an 
administrative  investigation. We will just have to take it  from 
there.''

``We  have removed those individuals from the workplace. If  they 
are not entitled to remain in the country and working, then under 
the  provisions of the law they will be removed from the  U.S.,'' 
she said.

Some 40 highly-qualified programmers, brought into the country by 
two Indian firms, Softech and Frontier, were arrested, handcuffed 
and  paraded like common criminals for not carrying  their  valid 
H1-B visas on their person.
