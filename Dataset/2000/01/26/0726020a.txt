By Arvind Aaron

WIJK  AAN ZEE, JAN. 25. Peter Leko of Hungary missed a  promising 
chance to end Vladimir Kramnik's unbeaten run of over a year  and 
a  place  in  the lead in the eighth round  of  the  Corus  chess 
tournament here at De Moriaan on Monday.

Lead  positions  remained  unchanged  with  drawn  games   taking 
precedence  over decisive results. World No.1 Garry  Kasparov  of 
Russia  and  No.2 Viswanathan Anand were held to draws  by  Smbat 
Lputian of Armenia and Van Wely of the Netherlands.

The  last week of the Corus chess tournament started  with  draws 
that leave Kramnik and Kasparov in the lead with 5.5 points  from 
eight  games,  half  a point ahead of Anand and  Leko  with  five 
points.  Five  rounds  remain to be played  in  the  category  18 
tournament,  the  first  super category tournament  of  the  21st 
century.

The  results  (eighth  round):  J.  Piket  (Ned)  drew  with   A. 
Morozevich (Rus), N. Short (Eng) lost to M. Adams (Eng), V. Anand
