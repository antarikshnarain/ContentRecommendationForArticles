Anwar alleges conspiracy


By P. S. Suryanarayana

SINGAPORE, JAN. 25. The trial of Malaysia's deposed Deputy  Prime 
Minister,  Mr. Anwar Ibrahim, in regard to allegations of  sodomy 
resumed in Kuala Lumpur today.

The  trial  had been adjourned on medical grounds,  during  which 
period  the Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, retained  power 
convincingly  in a general election despite the rise  of  Islamic 
fundamentalism as a political force.

At  today's hearing, Mr. Anwar's defence argued that the  charges 
against him, including the one relating to ``sodomy,'' were  part 
of a political conspiracy. Mr. Anwar is currently serving a  six-
year prison term, having been convicted and sentenced on April 14 
last  year on charges of having abused authority, while still  in 
office,  to  stifle a police investigation  into  allegations  of 
sexual misconduct by him.

Mr.  Anwar was represented by his key counsel, Mr. Karpal  Singh, 
who  was recently charged under the Sedition Act for a  statement 
he  had made in the same court during an earlier hearing  of  the 
same case.
