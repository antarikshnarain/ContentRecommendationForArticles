Arun Kumar, Parida exploit another placid track 


By Our Sports Reporter

AHMEDABAD, JAN. 25. A total of 275 on the Motera turf here was at 
best  a fighting one. But whatever hopes East Zone had of  making 
it  a  contest,  evaporated as opener J.  Arun  Kumar  struck  an 
unconquered  148  that saw South Zone to a  comprehensive  eight-
wicket victory in the Deodhar Trophy match on Tuesday.

That  South made it with 5.2 overs to spare shows that the  chase 
was always on. It was another of those pitches that make  batting 
such a pleasure.

Sadagopan  Mahesh,  promoted up the order, gave good  company  to 
Arun Kumar, their 126-run opening stand making the target of  276 
easy.  The two started cautiously, but opened out after a  couple 
of overs, driving the ball with aplomb.

Arun Kumar was a picture of confidence after his 121 against West 
and  looked  good  for  back-to-back  centuries  from  early  on. 
Striking the ball well straight down the ground and towards  mid- 
wicket, Arun Kumar often moved away and hit the ball for 4s  over 
cover, despite a sweeper cover.

Earlier,  put  in, East was propelled by  Orissa  batsman  Rashmi 
Ranjan Parida, who scored an unbeaten 106. Opener Shiv Sundar Das 
chipped in with a useful 52, even as the rest of the middle-order 
failed  to  come  up with big individual scores. A  cameo  37  by 
Shukla stretched the score later, when the chances of a  fighting 
total had just about diminished.

Shukla  hit  37  off 40 balls, with the help of  four  4s  and  a 
straight six off Kumaran.

This  was the first win for South in two matches, and the  second 
consecutive defeat for East, which has played three matches.
