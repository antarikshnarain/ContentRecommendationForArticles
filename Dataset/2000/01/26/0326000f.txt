Norwegian thrust to peace process


By V. S. Sambandan

COLOMBO, JAN. 25. A senior Norwegian official is currently in Sri 
Lanka  to discuss issues relating to the ethnic conflict  with  a 
cross-section  of the island's political parties for  an  on-the-
spot assessment of the situation.

The  visit of Mr. Leiv Lunde, Norway's Secretary for  Development 
Co-operation and Human Rights, is seen by Tamil political leaders 
as  a preliminary step before a larger decision is taken  on  the 
Norwegian  initiative  to negotiate an end to the  conflict.  Mr. 
Lunde, who spoke to members of the Ceylon Workers Congress  (CWC) 
yesterday,  is expected to meet leaders of other Tamil  political 
parties  as  well as the island's acting  Foreign  Minister,  Mr. 
Lakshman   Kiriella   and  the  Opposition  Leader,   Mr.   Ranil 
Wickremesinghe.

The  visit comes against the backdrop of a statement by  the  Sri 
Lankan  President,  Ms.  Chandrika  Kumaratunga,  recently   that 
attempts  to  involve Norway as a third-party  in  resolving  the 
conflict  were  stalled by the separatist  Liberation  Tigers  of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 

The  nature  of the Norwegian initiative is yet  to  be  defined, 
especially  given  the  situation  in which  both  the  two  main 
political  parties, the ruling People's Alliance  (PA)  coalition 
and the Opposition United National Party (UNP), are opposed to  a 
third-party mediator. 

The LTTE and the Tamil political parties see the role of a third-
party  mediator inevitable in the resolution  process.  Moreover, 
the  active  involvement of the Norwegian  thrust,  in  brokering 
talks with the Tigers, would also have to await a coming-together 
of the PA and the UNP, which the LTTE has been emphasising.

Mr. Lunde's visit also coincides with reports of a possible visit 
by the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Mr. Knut Vollebaek.
