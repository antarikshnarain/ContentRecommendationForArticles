Stop this mischief


Sir,  - The Gujarat Government's action permitting its  employees 
to  become members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh flouts  all 
canons  of objective public administration in a democracy.  As  a 
result,  the bureaucracy will be influenced by the  RSS  ideology 
and policies and this, in turn, will dilute its commitment to the 
objectives  and  Directive Principles of  the  Constitution.  The 
administration  will be used to subserve the ideology of a  group 
whose  principles are not in conformity with the  secular  ideals 
laid down in the Constitution. If and when a political party of a 
different   complexion  assumes  power,  it  may  issue   similar 
instructions  and  consequently the  entire  administration  will 
consist  of all members of extraneous bodies whose  ideology  and 
policies may not conform to the fundamental policies laid down in 
the  Constitution. A sort of civil war will be waged  within  the 
Government itself and the victims will be the people  themselves. 
This will be a tragedy too grave even to contemplate.

Before  the Gujarat example is followed by other States, it  will 
be necessary for the Centre, particularly for the Prime  Minister 
and  the BJP, committed to a National Agenda for  Governance,  to 
put  its  foot  down  and direct the  Government  of  Gujarat  to 
withdraw the orders.
