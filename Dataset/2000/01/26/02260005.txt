Jaswant for joint action against terrorism


By C. Raja Mohan

NEW  DELHI,  JAN. 25. Asserting that  India's  neighbourhood  now 
provides  the  ``single largest gene-pool of terrorism''  in  the 
world,  the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant  Singh,  today 
called  for  collective  Asian  action  against  the  forces   of 
extremism.

In  his address to an international conference on Asian  security 
here,  Mr. Singh pointed to the rise of non-state actors  ``fired 
by ideologies of extremism and fanaticism, and equipped with ever 
more lethal firepower''.

``Globalisation  enables  these terrorists  to  develop  linkages 
across continents,'' he added.

Arguing  that deepening of democracy was the critical  imperative 
of  Asian security, Mr. Singh said, ``narco-terrorism,  extremism 
and  small  arms proliferation constitute the biggest  threat  to 
plural societies'' in the region.

Mr.Singh declared that not only was India ``a factor of stability 
in Asia'', but it also had a big stake in the region's security.

``Instability,   extremism,   narcotics,   arms   smuggling   and 
terrorism,'' Mr. Singh said, ``are the common threats that  stand 
in  the way of the Indian and Asian people realising  their  true 
destiny''.

Pointing  to  the enormous diversity of  economic  and  political 
systems  as well as civilisations in Asia, the  External  Affairs 
Minister  argued that stability in the region cannot be built  on 
the  traditional  notions  of  balance of  power,  but  within  a 
framework of ``cooperative security''.

He  also referred to the threat from weapons of mass  destruction 
and called for ``regional initiatives'' in Asia

for ``de-legitimising'' nuclear weapons and reducing the risks of 
an accidental atomic war.

Measures  to reduce the readiness of nuclear arsenals  and  joint 
agreements on the ``no-first-use'' of nuclear weapons, Mr.  Singh 
said, ``suggest themselves as evident first steps''.

Speaking  at  a  session on ``limited  local  wars''  during  the 
conference,  the  Chief of the Army Staff, General  V.  P.  Malik 
cautioned the Government against an over-reliance on the Army  to 
combat terrorism and counter-insurgency.

Gen. Malik said the Armed Forces were the ``ultimate instrument''  
of national power and their ``early employment'' in low-intensity 
conflicts reduced future options.

Arguing  that the armed forces must be reserved for ``the  higher 
end''  of  the  conflict spectrum, he made  a  case  for  raising 
additional  forces or upgrading the existing paramilitary  troops 
to effectively combat terrorism.
