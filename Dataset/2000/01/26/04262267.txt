Mamata leads a silent peace rally in Calcutta


By Our Special Correspondent

KASBA, JAN. 25. The Railway Minister, Ms. Mamata Banerjee,  today 
led  a  peace rally in Kasba in South Calcutta  where  widespread 
violence was witnessed on Sunday following the murder of a CPI(M) 
leader, Gurupada Bagchi.

Ms.  Banerjee who is also the Trinamul Congress leader,  silently 
walked  through  Gariahat, the hub of South  Calcutta,  to  Kasba 
along  with her followers in protest against what she alleged  as 
the  CPI(M)-instigated  violence in the area.On  Sunday  morning, 
Gurupada Bagchi, secretary of the CPI(M) in Kasba, was shot  dead 
by armed goons while he was buying fish in the local market.  The 
angry  CPI(M)  workers  set the market on fire and  burnt  a  few 
vehicles.

Ms. Banerjee today demanded that the Jyoti Basu Government should 
rebuild  the burnt stalls in the market, the owners of which  are 
small-time  traders.``If the government turns a deaf ear  to  our 
demand,  we will collect money and help them (the shopowners)  to 
reconstruct their stalls.'' 

Ms.  Banerjee insisted that the Trinamul had no hand in  Sunday's 
murder as is being claimed by the CPI(M) leaders. She  maintained 
that  the  Sunday's  incident  was  the  result  of  intra-CPI(M) 
squabbles.

While  Ms. Banerjee was claiming that her party was innocent  and 
had  nothing  to do with the Kasba murder, one of  her  prominent 
Calcutta  Corporation councillors, Mr. Anup  Chatterjee,  grabbed 
headlines  for  allegedly trying to extort money from a  shop  in 
South Calcutta on Sunday.
