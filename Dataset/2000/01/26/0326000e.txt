COLOMBO,  JAN.  25. The former Indian Prime Minister, Mr.  I.  K. 
Gujral, and a host of international delegates will participate in 
a  three-day commemorative programme, highlighting the  need  for 
peace and national reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

to  be  held  in  the  memory  of  the  late  Tamil  leader   and 
internationally-renowned  constitutional expert, between  January 
29  and  February  1,  would be the launch of  a  trust  to  fund 
research  projects on national reconciliation,  minority  rights, 
pluralism and peace-making. 

Dr.  Tiruchelvam,  who was assassinated by a suicide-  bomber  on 
July  29  in  Colombo,  was  a  key-architect  of  the   proposed 
Constitutional reforms aimed at solving the decades-long conflict 
by providing for greater devolution of powers. 

In addition to Mr. Gujral, the former Chief Justice of India, Mr. 
P. N. Bhagwati, the former Bangladesh Foreign Minister, Mr. Kamal 
Hossain,  the former Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr.  Niaz  Naik, 
and the Chairperson of the U.N. Working Group on Minorities,  Mr. 
Asbjorn Eide, are scheduled to participate. 

A  two-day  seminar,  to discuss topics  such  as  human  rights, 
diversity  and  pluralism, constitutionalism  and  civil  society 
would  be held along with cultural events featuring  Ms.  Alarmel 
Valli,  Dr. Balamuralikrishna and an exhibition of  paintings  by 
Sri Lankan artists. 

A fellowship at the Harvard University in Dr. Tiruchelvam's  name 
and an award for the best constitutional paper at the  University 
of Colombo's Law faculty are also proposed. 

The programme would be conducted by the International Centre  for 
Ethnic  Studies,  the Law and Society Trust and  the  Tiruchelvam 
Associates.
