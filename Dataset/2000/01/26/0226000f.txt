By Our Special Correspondent

LUCKNOW,  JAN.  25.  A college student  was  killed  and  another 
injured  when  the  Special  Protection  Group  (SPG)  personnel, 
accompanying  the  former Prime Minister,  Mr.  Chandra  Shekhar, 
fired  at a group of students who had forced their entry  into  a 
compartment of the Lichchavi Express at Sadat station in Ghazipur 
district of Uttar Pradesh this morning.

The  incident led to large-scale vandalism by students of  nearby 
colleges,  who set ablaze six compartments of the train  and  its 
engine.  Two  coaches of another passenger train  were  also  set 
ablaze.

A  spokesman of the State Home Department here said, Mr.  Chandra 
Shekhar was going to Mau from New Delhi when a group of  students 
entered  his compartment as the train stopped at Sadat.  The  SPG 
personnel tried to evict them and a scuffle ensued. Two  students 
sustained  injuries,  when  the SPG personnel  opened  fire.  The 
students were rushed to the BHU Medical College at Varanasi where 
one  of  them,  Sri  Kant Prajapati, died.  The  other,  who  had 
sustained minor injuries, was discharged.

Mr. Chandra Shekhar later left for Ballia, his home district.
