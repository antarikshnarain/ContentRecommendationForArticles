Hindujas 'unable' to come to India


By Our Special Correspondent

NEW  DELHI,  JAN. 25. The Hinduja brothers have conveyed  to  the 
Central  Bureau of Investigation that they would not be  able  to 
personally  come to India for questioning in the  Bofors  payoffs 
case. 

Notices  to the influential NRI brothers were sent by the CBI  on 
January  12  to  London  and  Geneva,  asking  them  to  ``join'' 
investigations  in  the nearly decade-old probe into  the  Bofors 
payoffs case. The notices were sent to Mr. Gopichand Hinduja, Mr. 
Srichand Hinduja and Mr. Prakash Hinduja through Indian missions. 
They were given a week's time to respond to the CBI notice. 

According  to  well-placed  sources in the CBI,  the  agency  was 
examining the response of the Hinduja brothers who cited business 
reasons  and  expressed  their inability to  come  to  India  for 
``joining''  the probe into the Rs. 64 crore payoffs case in  the 
gun  deal  of  March 1986 with the Swedish armaments  firm,  A  B 
Bofors. 

On  January  14, a spokesman for the Hinduja group  had  said  in 
London that the three brothers had received letters from the  CBI 
seeking ``certain clarifications'' with regard to the case.

``We have offered our full cooperation to the agency in the  past 
and to successive governments for any clarification in this case. 
We will be happy to offer any further clarifications required. We 
have consistently maintained that we have nothing to do with  the 
gun deal,'' the spokesman had said. 

In the first-ever chargesheet filed in the Bofors payoffs case in 
October  in  a Delhi court, the CBI  stated  that  investigations 
against the Hinduja brothers were ``going on.''
