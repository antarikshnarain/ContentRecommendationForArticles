Central spoils North's party 


By Our Sports Reporter

PUNE,  JAN.  25. Central Zone threw open the Deodhar  Trophy  and 
spoilt North Zone's clean slate with a surprise three-wicket  win 
at the Nehru Stadium here today.

Central  Zone,  which had failed to defend a  total  of  300-plus 
against  East  last  week, survived some  anxious  moments  while 
chasing  238  today,  after its bowlers had done  enough  in  the 
morning to restrict North Zone's formidable batting line-up.

Central  won the match with three overs to spare, but it was  far 
from  an exhilarating game, as most batsmen struggled for  timing 
even  though bowlers strayed in their line. What swung the  match 
in  Central's  favour was its decision to field first on  a  damp 
wicket in hazy conditions. 

Makeshift  opener  Vijay  Dahiya and the  dangerous  Jadeja  were 
dismissed  by Harvinder Sodhi within 11 overs. First  change  Jai 
Prakash  Yadav  bowled  a tight spell  in  tandem  with  left-arm 
spinner  Murali  Karthik. North lost three wickets  within  eight 
balls and was tottering 74 for five in the 19th over.

North  skipper Vikram Rathour sat out the second session  due  to 
indisposition  and  naturally,  Jadeja took  over.  The  ex-India 
player  failed  to turn the match around, primarily  because  his 
opening  bowlers  gave  too much away in the first  15  overs  by 
Central openers Gagan Khoda and Jyoti Yadav.

Khoda,  who  accumulated 71 (84b, 11x4) and Yadav were  a  little 
casual. It took a nugget of an innings from Devendra Bundela (45, 
52b,  5x4), who came in at 138 for three in the 31st  over  after 
Khurasiya  had  smacked a six and a four in two  balls  and  then 
threw his wicket to Robin Singh. 

Central now has two points from two games and North has four from 
three.  North plays its last match against South on  January  31. 
Central meets South in Mumbai on January 28.
