Cherish the delusion 


Sir,  -  ``India  must trust me,''  says  Gen.  Pervez  Musharraf 
(TheHindu, Jan. 17). A civil statement, most welcome.

``Indian  High Commission staff badly beaten up on way to  church 
in Islamabad (the same issue)''. An uncivilised act in line  with 
the Kargil intrusions and the IA plane hijack.

That  deeds  speak  louder  than words  is  perhaps  beyond  this 
General. A pity.

``My  Government is legitimate and popular'', says  the  General. 
Legitimate?  The world sees him as an illegal usurper  who  back-
stabbed  the  very man who made him the army chief out  of  turn. 
Popular?  Is  it  not a popular delusion  to  conclude  that  the 
unpopularity of the preceding ruler necessarily means  popularity 
for the next one? So be it.

The  General  is, of course, entitled to his  own  illusions  and 
delusions about his ability to solve problems and lead nations to 
peace. Amen.

But  haven't  we heard all this before? From  Pakistani  military 
rulers? And a little while ago, from a little Austrian  corporal? 
Oh, perish the thought. Hail, tinpot General!

Sir,- Kudos to TheHindu for publishing the timely interview  with 
Gen.  Musharraf.  We are well aware that much  water  has  flowed 
under  the bridge between India and Pakistan since 1947. As  what 
happened in the past cannot be gone into and set right now, India 
should be more careful and highly diplomatic in its dealings with 
the  neighbour to save the subcontinent from further Kargils  and 
hijacks.
