Lankesh dead 


By Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE,   JAN.  25.  Mr.  P.Lankesh,  noted  Kannada   writer, 
journalist,  playwright  and film personality  passed  away  here 
today.  He  was 65 and was stated to be suffering  from  a  liver 
ailment. He is survived by wife, two daughters and a son.

Though  better  known as the editor of the Kannada  weekly  named 
after  himself, Lankesh Patrike, his interests were  varied.  Mr. 
Lankesh  was  a lecturer in English at the Central  College  here 
before  he  ventured into journalism and started  the  weekly  in 
1980. 

Mr. Lankesh was in many respects an avant-gardist in the field of 
Kannada  journalism and revelled in controversial  and  vitriolic 
writings.  His  Lankesh  Patrike  became  known  for  its  highly 
individualistic first person articles lampooning and exposing the 
weaknesses and failures of the politicians in power. 

It deliberately avoided the primness that went with other Kannada 
magazines.  Though there were other Kannada journals in the  past 
known for their barbed writings, Lankesh Patrike stood out as  it 
shunned advertisements.
