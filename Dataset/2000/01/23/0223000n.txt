Ragging victim alleges conspiracy


CUTTACK, JAN 22 The alleged inhuman ragging of a Plus three  girl 
student of the prestigious Ravenshaw college here took a new turn 
today with the victim alleging that a conspiracy had been hatched 
to hush up the matter.

In a seven-page sensational letter, written to the college ladies 
Hostel superintendent, the girl demanded stringent action against 
seven  senior  girls for torturing and harassing  her  during  an 
unauthorised welcome function, organised in the Hostel complex on 
January 12 night. Daughter of a CPI (M) leader from Rourkela, the 
victim said though she remained senseless for two hours after her 
ragging,  neither  was  she  shifted  to  the  hospital  nor  any 
complaint  lodged with police by her father keeping in  view  the 
sanctity and prestige of the institution.
