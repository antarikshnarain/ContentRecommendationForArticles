By Our Staff Reporter

KARUR, JAN. 22. The Kerala Chief Minister, Mr. E. K. Nayanar, has 
warned  that  the  country would face bigger  agitations  by  the 
working  classes  if the BJP Government continued to  pursue  its 
``retrogade  economic policies which have brought about a  crisis 
in various industrial sectors.''

Declaring  open  an  office building of the CPI(M)  at  Karur  on 
Friday  night,  Mr.  Nayanar said the on going  strikes  by  port 
employees, EB workers in Uttar Pradesh and the recent strikes  in 
the insurance and transport sectors were just a manifestation  of 
the  resentment caused among the people by the economic  policies 
pursued by the BJP.

The  adverse  impact  of the economic policies, in  the  name  of 
liberalisation and globalisation, pursued by the BJP  Government, 
was already being felt with the closure of hundreds of industrial 
units in the country. Lakhs of people had been rendered  jobless, 
adding to the already acute unemployment problem in the  country. 
The  move to allow private sector investment in banks,  insurance 
sectors and even the airports had adversely affected the domestic 
industry, he said.

Mr.  N.  Sankaraiah,  State Secretary, CPI(M),  called  upon  the 
allies of the BJP in Tamil Nadu to thwart the attempts to convert 
the country into a fascist and communal State. He called upon all 
secular forces to join hands in fighting against the threat posed 
by  the communal and retrogade economic policies pursued  by  the 
BJP Government.

Senior leaders of the CPI(M), including Mr. P. Ramachandran,  Mr. 
T. K. Ranjarajan, Mr. G. Ramakrishnan, Mr. G. Rathinavelu, Mr. S. 
M.  Palaniappan,  Mr. G. Kumar, district  secretary,  and  others 
spoke. Mr. M. Chinnasamy, AIADMK MP, Mr. K. C. Palanisamy of  the 
DMK,  Mr.  T.  S. Ramiyan, district  secretary,  CPI,  and  local 
representatives    from   other   political    parties    offered 
felicitations.
