Arun Kumar's century pales before Kambli, Muzumdar's onslaught


By Our Special Correspondent

RAJKOT,  JAN.  22. Capitalising on curious  cricketing  deja  vu, 
Vinod Kambli and Amol Muzumdar redeemed themselves and their team 
with  a double century stand, as West Zone chased 317 to win  its 
Deodhar Trophy match against South at the Municipal Stadium  here 
today.

Kambli  and Muzumdar came together at 64 for two and put  on  226 
for the third wicket, controlling the tempo of the run chase with 
ease. Under conventional circumstances, a total of 317 could have 
virtually guaranteed victory to South, but no one had counted  on 
Kambli  and Muzumdar producing what could only be described as  a 
turnaround performance.

Today Kambli scored his second successive unbeaten century, after 
106  not  out against North, but this was  a  brighter,  worthier 
innings. His 119 not out (103b, 10x4, 3x6) featured some  stylish 
strokeplay,  including  two sixes off Aashish  Kapoor,  and  most 
importantly  some  aggressive running between  wickets.  Muzumdar 
looked  comfortable  against  the South bowlers and  got  to  his 
century in very good time (109, 108 balls, 10x4). When he was run 
out, West was still 28 short, but had seven overs to get them.

The  sheer driving purpose of this third-wicket stand washed  out 
an  equally  attractive century from South Zone  opener  J.  Arun 
Kumar (121, 121b, 13x4, 2x6) in the morning.

Kambli and Muzumdar shared an unbroken 208 for the  second-wicket 
against  Central Zone two seasons ago. Today their 226-run  stand 
came  within  six runs short of the best for any  wicket  in  the 
Deodhar Trophy - 232 for the opening wicket between Ashu Dani and 
Vikram Rathour last season. 

Before  the  start  of the match, both the  teams  and  officials 
observed  a  two-minute  silence in memory  of  the  former  BCCI 
President  M.A. Chidambaram, who passed away in  Chennai  earlier 
this week.
