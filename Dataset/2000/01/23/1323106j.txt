About Katchal


KATCHAL,  a  tiny island in the middle of the  Nicobars,  is  now 
called "sunrise island". The scenic Nancowry harbour lies on  its 
western  side.  It has more than  39  settlements,  predominantly 
controlled by six traditional village councils, which work  under 
its tribal council.

Geographically,  Katchal encompasses an area of 174  sq.km.  with 
its  highest point, 835 ft above mean sea level, on  the  eastern 
side.  The  island  is nearly 230 nautical miles  south  of  Port 
Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar islands. In  short, 
it  lies near the Great Nicobar, the southern most island in  the 
Andamans, and Indira Point, the southern most point in India.

Katchal's  hills of calcareous sand stone were formed during  the 
tertiary period. The western side of the island is of more recent 
origin,  made  up  of  coralline  alluvium  mixed  with   decayed 
vegetable matter and loam. 

Covered  with dense forest, Katchal is also home to a species  of 
monkey (Macaques Umbrosus).

The entire Nicobar group of islands, including Katchal, has  been 
declared a protected tribal area. With an estimated population of 
over  9,000, including Sri Lankan refugees,  Government  servants 
and Ranchi Biharis, Indians can visit it with special  permission 
from  the  Deputy Commissioner, Andamans  district,  Port  Blair. 
There are limited basic amenities.
