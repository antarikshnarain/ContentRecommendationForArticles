Pisces


Sun sign Pisces (Feb. 19 to March 20)

Artists  and  career-women  will realise the  fruition  of  their 
plans. Some public servants may be promoted. Those connected with 
tourism and hoteliering should be better placed. Contractors  and 
industrialists will find a boom in demand for their services  and 
products. A business partner or a sibling or an elderly  relative 
may turn a deaf ear to your propositions. Leave him or her be for 
the present. Birth of a baby is due shortly. Your spouse may have 
a  spell of indifferent health. Income should be  good.  Moderate  
speculation will pay well. Mixed prospects for politicians.

Uttarabhadrapada, and Revathi)

Good  prospects  are seen for those in public service by  way  of 
promotion  and transfer. Students, politicians and  professionals 
will  do  well in their pursuits. Those in  the  hospitality  and 
sight-seeing  business, artists and women will be  successful  in 
almost every worthwhile endeavour they undertake. With a spurt in 
expenses  due  ahead, it will only be wise for you to  plan  your 
budget carefully and adhere to it. 

Chandrashtama:  From  10-46 a.m. on January 27 to  9-27  p.m.  on 
January 29.
