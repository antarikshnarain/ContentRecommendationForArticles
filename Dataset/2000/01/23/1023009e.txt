Cancer


Sun sign Cancer (June 21 to July 20)

Students, professionals and sportspersons should register growth. 
Some in government service could seek a change of scene. The work 
atmosphere  may  be strenuous and less remunerative.  Keep  aloof 
from ill-meaning friends and relatives. Never discuss your family 
or official plans openly and avoid getting into arguments.  Defer 
new business ventures. Financially, you will not be much troubled 
if  you  spend judiciously. Careful speculation could  bring  you  
some gain.

Those in service may look to get orders of transfer. Politicians, 
students, realtors and professionals may be troubled by  changing 
winds.  Artists  and career women will benefit by lying  low  and 
preparing  well for tasks ahead. Romance and speculation may  not 
yield   desired   results.   Avoid  verbal   tangles   and   show 
consideration  for  the views of others.  Business  partners  and 
subordinates may not always be trustworthy. Monetary flows  could 
be far from satisfactory.
