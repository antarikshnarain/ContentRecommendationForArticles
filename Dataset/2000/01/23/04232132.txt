Underworld at it again?


By Our Special Correspondent

MUMBAI,  JAN.  22. Is the underworld once again amidst  the  film 
world  here, using its muscle power and even guns, to drive  good 
bargains  or  extort money? Friday's attempt on the life  of  Mr. 
Rakesh  Roshan,  actor-turned-producer and  director,  being  the 
latest, could be a pointer.

After his new box-office hit, Kaho na.... pyar hai, Mr. Roshan is 
said to have received threats and demands from some  unidentified 
persons.

The angle of extortion is now being probed by the police,  though 
this kind of crime has come down of late. What, however, irks the 
police  is  that the high-profile personalities from  the  tinsel 
world are disinclined to file complaints of threats.

Mr. Roshan himself has had security cover in the past, which  was 
later  withdrawn  - it is not clear whether he wanted  it  to  be 
removed  or the police felt, according to its assessment, it  was 
not  required,  and so had several others but there  has  been  a 
tremendous  strain on the police force on account  of  inadequate 
manpower.

Some  time  ago, a film producer, Mr. Manmohan Shetty,  had  been 
targeted.  A leading distributor, Mr. Anil Thadani, too  had  the 
attention  of  the  extortion trade directed at  him.  Does  this 
signal a new trend, a resurgence?

Obviously  the underworld likes to have its cake and eat it  too, 
insofar  as  the  film world is concerned. Though  the  trade  in 
general likes to deny it is a widespread practice, the underworld 
has been funding film production. And where it has not, it  likes 
to barge in through extortion.
