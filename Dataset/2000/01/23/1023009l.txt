Aquarius


Sun sign Aquarius (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)

Industrialists  and  contractors must strain every nerve  not  to 
slip behind in promises made and their schedules of  fulfillment. 
Some government servants may seek a new post. A sudden shift  may 
cause dislocation for some in the uniformed services. Funds could 
pose problems and speculation may not bring any rewards. Romantic 
affairs  may prove less than rewarding. Professionals  must  shed  
any tendency to become complacent. 

Moon  in  KUMBHA  (Stars - the last two  quarters  of  Dhanishta, 
Satabhishak, and the first three quarters of Poorvabhadrapada)

Exciting opportunities will unfold for artists and working women. 
A  visit  to holy places and travelling on business  are  likely. 
Romantic  associations could bring some favour.  Speculation  may 
not help. Some of you are likely to move house or go in for a new 
or better car or two-wheeler. 

Chandrashtama:  From 3-42 a.m. on the night of January  24/25  to 
10-46 a.m. on January 27.
