THE  ARTIC  is at the other corner of the world. But  14  persons 
travelled  all the way from the North Pole, particularly  Alaska, 
for more than 27 hours to be here, in Chennai.

So  what drew them out of their frigid climes to a city  that  is 
notorious   for its torrid summer?. The countrywide  pulse  polio 
immunisation  programme which is billed as the  largest  people's 
movement in the country since Independence.

The  14  member team of Rotarians will be  closely  watching  the 
fourth and final phase of the polio programme to be held with the 
support of the Rotary movement on January 23. 

Introducing the team, Ms. Rekha Shetty, District Governor, Rotary 
District 3230, said they will study the programme in which a huge 
volunteer  army,  mobilised  by  Rotary will  aid  the  State  in 
administering vaccine and IEC activities.

Led  by Ms. Allana Wenholz Bergh, District Governor,  D5010,  the 
team  will keep a close watch on the way polio immunisation  will 
be conducted in Rotary district 3230. ``We want to learn from the 
experience of Rotarians here. Of course we will help wherever  we 
can,  but the thrust is rather on learning from here''  says  Ms. 
Bergh, who appeared excited about the experience, 24 hours  after 
she landed in Chennai.

She  is accompanied by senior Rotarians from the  same  district, 
but with varied interests. 

There   are  bankers,  telecom  professionals,   social   service 
entrepreneurs and sports enthusiasts.
