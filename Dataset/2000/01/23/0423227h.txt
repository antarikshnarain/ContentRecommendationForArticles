No disruption in Govt. work: Pondy CM


By Our Staff Reporter

PONDICHERRY,  JAN. 22.The Chief Minister, Mr. R. V.  Janakiraman, 
today claimed that there was no disruption in work although there 
were only three ministers in the Cabinet.

Addressing press persons here, he said there was no disruption of 
work  and  implementation of schemes was going on  smoothly  even 
though only three of the six Ministers were in the Cabinet.

Mr.  Janakiraman said the Congress (I)-led opposition was  trying 
to  gain  political mileage out of uniform sales  tax  issue.  He 
reiterated that as long as his Ministry was holding the reins  of 
administration,   the   new  rate  of  taxation  would   not   be 
implemented. The Central team that visited Pondicherry on January 
19  and 20 had also made it clear that no State Government  could 
be forced to enforce the new tax regime.

Stating that the opposition had no other issue on hand except the 
sales  tax,  he  said they were trying  to  hoodwink  the  people 
claiming  to  be the champions of people's welfare. He  said  his 
Ministry  had been successfully resisting the new taxation  while 
adding there was no threat to his Government.

Asked  if there was a plan to expand the cabinet to induct  three 
more  Ministers to fill the vacancies created by the  resignation 
of  Mr. R. Viswanathan (CPI), Mr. P. Kannan and Mr. C.  Jayakumar 
(TMC),  he  said  if any necessity arose  for  induction  of  new 
Ministers he would seek the counsel of Tamil Nadu Chief  Minister 
and the TMC leader.

Mr.  Janakiraman  declined to convene a special  session  of  the 
Assembly  to discuss the sales tax issue and adopt  a  resolution 
against it.

Declining  to  comment further on the resignation  of  the  Local 
Administration  Minister, Mr. C. Jayakumar, he said he was  still 
examining  the issue. He further said the coalition  Ministry  in 
the Union Territory continued as the TMC continued its support to 
his government.
