Rest puts players in a spot


By Arvind Aaron

WIJK  AAN ZEE, JAN. 22. The long rest that the top three  players 
have had before this Corus chess tournament has not done them any 
good  as they have run into greater difficulties than they  would 
have  had this event come at the middle of the  season.  Although 
still undefeated, Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand and  Vladimir 
Kramnik  have had more than their usual share of trouble  at  the 
board.

Friday was the second of three rest days and play will resume  on 
Saturday with Kasparov and Kramnik enjoying a one point lead over 
Anand and the rest. Eight rounds remain to be played.

``Anand  has  been disappointing for my money,'' said  one  Dutch 
International Master. But taking a closer look, he has had  three 
blacks  and drawn all of them. He missed scoring off one  of  his 
two whites and that too against Kramnik, so far the best  player. 
His  blacks haven't been cool. It was a rough ride  against  both 
Timman and Leko. 

Kasparov has had his share of the trouble against Piket and Adams 
and was in graver danger. Kramnik in trouble in the fifth round.

Anand meets Korchnoi on Saturday with the white pieces.  Kasparov 
plays Short with the black pieces. 

lThe standings: 1-2 G. Kasparov (Rus), V.Kramnik (Rus) 4/5  each, 
3-  5  V.Anand (Ind), J.Piket (Ned), P.Leko (Hun)  3  each,  6-11 
M.Adams,  V.Korchnoi (Swz), A.Morozevich (Rus), P.Nikolic  (Bih), 
N.Short  (Eng),  J.Timman (Ned) 2.5 each, 12 Judit  Polgar  (Hun) 
1.5, 13 L.Van Wely (Ned) 1, 14 S.Lputian (Arm) 0.5.
