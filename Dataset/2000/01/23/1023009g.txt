Virgo


Sun sign Virgo (Aug. 22 to Sept. 22)

Students,  career  women, professionals, artists  and  commission 
agents will find the outlook change in their favour. Those in the 
printing  and stationary fields should seize this lucky  week  by 
the  forelock  and advance. Your financial  position  should  be, 
overall, satisfactory. Favourable decisions are ahead in  matters 
pending in court. A daughter in the family will win trophies  and  
awards. Do not take the risk of losing money in speculation. 

Moon in KANYA (Stars - the last three quarters of Uttaraphalguni, 
Hashta and the first two quarters of Chitta)

Tides  will  flow  in  favour  of  women  and  artists.  However, 
students,  politicians  and professionals may find the  winds  of 
fortune  changing.  Some government servants could be  forced  to 
accept  an unwarranted transfer or go on leave. There could be  a 
happy  turn  in court proceedings. Children  indisposed  must  be 
treated  with  understanding.  A  grown-up  ward  may  cause  you 
uneasiness because you are not able to read his or her mind.
