Aries


Sun sign Aries (March 21 to April 20)

Beneficial  times  for  sportspersons,  artists,   professionals, 
students  and working women. Those in government can expect  both 
promotion  and  favourable transfer. Good support  from  business 
partners,   influential  friends  and  elders  will  speed   your 
endeavours now. Careful spending will enable you to take care  of 
unexpected  expenditure. You may have to pacify a grown-up  child  
who feels neglected. 

Moon  in  MESHA  (Stars  - Aswini,  Bharani  and  Krittika  first 
quarter)

Sportspersons  will have very good chances to show  their  mettle 
and  gain  recognition  and  rewards.  Students,  career   women, 
professionals, artists and traders may be able to advance against 
odds. Politicians and realtors are into a mixed phase.  Promotion 
is at hand for defence and police employees.  

Chandrashtama:  From 9-27 p.m. on January 29 and extends to  next 
week.
