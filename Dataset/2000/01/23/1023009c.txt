Taurus


Sun sign Taurus (April 21 to May 20)

Those  in electrical, electronic and computer related lines  will 
scale new heights of success. Students, sportspersons and traders 
should also do equally well. Transfer or going on leave is on the 
cards  for  government servants. Politicians,  career  women  and 
artists may face mixed fortunes. Businesspersons could find their 
new project moving ahead well. A romantic liaison and investments 
in speculation-based ventures should bear fruit. 

Moon  in RISHABHA (Stars - Krittika last three Quarters,  Rohini, 
Mrigasira first two quarters)

Artists  and women pursuing business or other careers  should  do 
well. You may have to make do with limited funds as expenses  are 
going to run high. Speculation and romance may not pay at all. Do 
not be in a hurry to start a new venture. If planning to quit the 
present  job,  carefully assess the prospects of the new  one  on 
offer.  Take time to guide children regarding their  studies  and 
extra-curricular activities. Be patient with elders.
