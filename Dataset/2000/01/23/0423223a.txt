NDA move to take out rally assailed


By Our Special Correspondent

CHENNAI,  JAN.  22. The Ambedkar  Iyyakkankalin  Kootamaippu  has 
criticised  the  NDA  move to take out a rally  in  Cuddalore  on 
February 2.

Addressing  reporters here today, the Kootamaippu president,  Mr. 
V.  Balasundaram,  said  normality  had  returned  to   Cuddalore 
district  only  now after a series of violent incidents.  If  the 
constituents of the NDA were allowed to take out a procession, it 
would only lead to renewal of tension in the district. 

He  alleged  that  the Government was partisan  in  its  approach 
towards  Dalits. While Dalits and their leaders were not  allowed 
to  organise  processions  and meetings in  the  district,  other 
community leaders were given permission.

Referring  to  the PMK's demand for a ban on  Dalit  Panthers  of 
India led by Mr. Tirumavalavan, he said if at all a party had  to 
be banned for indulging in violent activities then PMK should  be 
banned first. ``It is the PMK which has been instigating communal 
clashes in the State and has been resorting to violence to create 
terror among Dalits''.
