relations  with business partners, friends and relatives will  be 
to your advantage now. Women are advised to be careful with their 
health. Go carefully in matters related to the heart. Invest only  
small sums in race, lottery, etc.

affairs may not progress to your liking. Travel may keep you away 
from home.
