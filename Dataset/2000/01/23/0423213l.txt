By Our Special Correspondent

MUMBAI,  JAN.  22. Maharashtra, which has adopted  uniform  floor 
rate  of  sales tax for 206 items following the decision  at  the 
Finance  Ministers Conference announced on Friday that sales  tax 
on another 23 items - from artificial silk to plastic pipes, hand 
pumps,  tamarind, dry fruits, ferro alloys etc., - would also  be 
reduced from Saturday.

According to the Maharashtra Finance Minister, Mr. Jayant  Patil, 
Maharashtra  ``being a progressive State, the  responsibility  of 
assuming leadership in this matter has come to be with us.''  But 
his  regret was that when all the Union Territories were  falling 
in line, Pondicherry was being indifferent.
