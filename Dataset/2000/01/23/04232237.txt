TMC charge on books purchase


By Our Special Correspondent

CHENNAI,  JAN. 22. The TMC has charged that the State  Government 
had not followed the rules in the purchase of books for the newly 
opened Valluvar libraries in the State.

In  a  statement  today,  Mr.  Peter  Alphonse,  MP  and  general 
secretary  of  the party, said that for the  annual  purchase  of 
books for the libraries, the Government had adopted the  practice 
of getting the price list from all the publishers and a 25-member 
expert  committee would choose the titles and also fix the  price 
for  the books intended to be purchased. This practice  had  been 
given  a go-by while purchasing books, totally valued at Rs.  6.5 
crores  for the libraries being opened in all parts of the  State 
each at a cost of Rs. 3,000.

The  TMC  had  received  information  that  the  Government   had 
purchased  the  books from five publishers at  prices  quoted  by 
them. This is said to have resulted in a loss of about Rs.  three 
crores.  Other publishers tried in vain to meet the Minister  for 
Tamil  Development  and  Culture,  Mr.  M.  Tamizhkudimagan,  the 
statement said.

Mr.  Peter Alphonse wanted to know from the Minister whether  the 
information  received  by  the TMC was correct or  not.  He  also 
demanded that the names of the books purchased and their  authors 
and publishers be made public.

This  alleged  irregularity had taken place at a  time  when  the 
panchayats and town panchayats in the State were passing  through 
severe financial crisis due to non-flow of funds and grants  from 
the  State  Government.  Those,  who had  supplied  milk  to  the 
cooperative  societies, had not received their dues  and  several 
drinking  water  supply  and augmentation schemes  could  not  be 
pushed through due to want of funds, he said.

Mr. Alphonse said that the Government owed an explanation to  the 
people to dispel the lurking doubts in the minds of the people.
