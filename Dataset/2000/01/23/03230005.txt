Pak. again fails to become IORARC member


MUSCAT, JAN. 22. Pakistan has once again failed in its attempt to 
become a member of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for  Regional 
Cooperation (IORARC), with the member-countries rejecting that it 
had not complied with the principles of the grouping.

Pakistan's  application  for  the membership of  the  19-  member 
grouping  was  taken up by the committee of  officials  at  their 
meeting last night. 

They  decided  that  Pakistan  could not  be  admitted  into  the 
association  as it had still not given the Most  Favoured  Nation 
(MFN) status to India.

The association's charter supports the principle of global  trade 
liberalisation  consistent  with  WTO principles  and  it  stands 
committed to the principle of non-discriminatory treatment to all 
member-countries in respect of giving the MFN status.
