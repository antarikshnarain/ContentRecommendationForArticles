Gemini


Sun sign Gemini (May 21 to June 20)

Fine trends for those in politics, defence and police.  Students, 
professionals,   commission   agents,  artists  and   women   may 
experience  fluctuating fortunes. Business persons will find  new 
projects  get off the blocks quickly. News about the birth  of  a 
child is due to reach you shortly. The eligible singles will have 
very good chance of locating the partner of their heart's desire.  
Race and lottery may yield moderate gains. Shun love and romance.

Arudra and the first three quarters of Punarvasu)

Students  and  professionals  must make the  most  of  favourable 
breaks coming their way now. Some natives may find the  pressures 
at  home and office trying. But, the arrival of a new-born and  a 
function  bringing joy should engage your energies and  give  you 
the  much  needed change of atmosphere. The eligible  single  may 
move  nearer  to tying the knot. Profits  from  speculation  will 
contribute to your sense of well-being.
