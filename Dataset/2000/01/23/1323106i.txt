Rays of hope 


KATCHAL,  in  the Andaman and Nicobar islands, was  in  the  news 
recently when those aboard the cruise liner, "M. V. Swaraj Dweep" 
witnessed  the first rays of the millennial sun in this  part  of 
the world.

"Though I heard about the event, I was too busy at home to see it 
happen," said a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee, Mariaye, an employee at 
the rubber plantation processing unit at Katchal.

In contrast, 42-year-old Sayeed, a grocer who came to the  island 
a  decade ago, leaving behind his family at Madurai, Tamil  Nadu, 
was  philosophical.  "What  I  miss is  my  family  and  not  the 
millennial  sunrays," he said, while selling soft drinks  to  the 
guests.

After  the  ship  entered the Revello Channel  and  lay  anchored 
between  the  Nancowry and Katchal islands  (after  covering  235 
nautical miles in about 16 hours from Port Blair) the  passengers 
had to do some "acrobatics" to jump on to a floating pontoon  and 
then to a waiting motorised boat to reach the island.

A  colourful banner read: "Let the era of peace, prosperity,  and 
universal  brotherhood  descend  with the first  sunrays  of  the 
millennium".

To add a touch of radiance, a "millennium mela" was organised  by 
the   Public  Works  Department,  Andaman  and  Nicobar   Islands 
administration,  in the fervent hope that Central Ministers,  led 
by  Ms.  Uma Bharati, would turn up. But because  of  unfortunate 
events  running  in parallel, the mela turned out to  be  a  damp 
squib.

The foundation for a Surya stumbha was laid on the campus of  the 
island's circuit house.                 

A   Rs.  3  commemorative  stamp  was  released  by  the   Postal 
Department.

Mr. S. M. Naqvi, Regional Director, Government of India  Regional 
Tourist Office, Chennai, who accompanied a group of  presspersons 
from Chennai, said the first rays had raised everybody's hopes 
and aspirations.
