Counter-claim by Pakistan 


By Amit Baruah

ISLAMABAD,  JAN.  22.  Pakistan,  however,  came  out  with   the 
allegation that the Indian forces ``crossed'' the Line of Control 
in   the   Iftikharabad  sub-sector  in  the  Chhamb   area   and 
``launched'' a company-strength attack on a Pakistani post. 

``The  Government of Pakistan will be lodging a protest with  the 
Government of India... adhering to its policy of peace,  Pakistan 
will  continue  to exercise restraint... We call  upon  India  to 
exhibit  responsibility and refrain from aggressive action  which 
could result in grave consequences...

``We  call  upon  the  world community  to  restrain  India  from 
escalating  tension in the region,'' a Foreign  Office  spokesman 
said at a briefing this evening.
