Cong.(I) releases first list of candidates


By our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, JAN.22. The Congress(I) today announced its candidates 
for the 108 constituencies of South Bihar, which go to the  polls 
in  the  first phase on February 12. In keeping with  Mrs.  Sonia 
Gandhi's  wish  to give a new profile to the party,  by  fielding 
fresh  faces and younger candidates, little over 23 per  cent  of 
the nominees are under 40 years of age.

Of  the 108 seats in the Jharkhand area, 40 are reserved for  the 
SC/STs. Fifty per cent of the tickets have, therefore, been given 
to  candidates  belonging  to the OBC, SC  and  ST.  The  party's 
Central Election Committee cleared the first list this  afternoon 
after several meetings over the past three days.

Prominent  among  the nominees are  the  Congress(I)  Legislature 
Party leader, Mr. Ramashray Prasad Singh, former PCC(I) president 
Dr. Sarfaraz Ahmed, two of the recently appointed BPCC(I) working 
presidents, Mr. Furkan Ansari and Prof. Ram Jatan Sinha, and  the 
former president of the Jharkhand Regional Congress(I) Committee, 
Mrs. Sushila Kerketta. Despite Mrs. Gandhi's reported interest in 
fielding  a  greater number of women candidates, only  six  women 
figure  in  the  list - a mere 5.6 per cent  of  the  total.  One 
candidate for the Masaurhi seat, is yet to be finalised. 

Sources said that the PCC(I) chief, Mr. Sadanand Singh, had  been 
asked  to  clarify  some points, adding that the  seat  had  been 
``earmarked'' for a woman candidate.

Mr.  Devipada  Upadhyay (formerly of the CPI) and  Mr.  Hari  Ram 
Sardar  (formerly of the JMM-S), who joined the Congress(I)  five 
days ago, have been given tickets.
