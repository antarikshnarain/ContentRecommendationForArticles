Lankans have no answer to 'Sodhi special' 


By Sanjay Rajan

COLOMBO, JAN. 22. There was a spring in their step which had been 
missing  thus far. But today was refreshingly different and  that 
made all the difference in the end.

Playing against Sri Lanka in a contest billed as the match of the 
Youth World Cup by the vociferous home supporters, India  bearded 
the  lion  in its den to win by 41 runs and top Group II  of  the 
Super-Eights. India, however, had to survive some  nerve-wracking 
moments as Rashan Pieris, the diminutive wicketkeeper, threatened 
to pull it off for the host at the Premadasa Stadium.

The  boy who made it all possible for India was  Reetinder  Singh 
Sodhi. The Punjab lad held the innings together with a gritty  74 
(81b, 4x4, 1x6) and came back to take two wickets.

The  contest between the joint favourites was of  no  consequence 
with both sides having already qualified for the semifinals.  But 
the  real  tug was for the advantage that goes with  topping  the 
group-to  avoid a meeting with Pakistan, the third favourite,  in 
the last four stage.

India  will  meet Australia, which qualified as the  second  team 
from  Group  I,  in the second semifinals  at  the  Saravanamuthu 
Stadium on January 25 while Sri Lanka clashes with Pakistan,  the 
Group I topper, in Galle a day before.

India,  opting to bat, lost Manish Sharma early and  skipper  Md. 
Kaif a little later even as opener Ravneet Ricky guided the  side 
to 74 by the 18th over. The Sri Lankan opening bowlers,  Nissanka 
and Ganegama, were accurate but with the pitch unhelpful, skipper 
Gajanayake brought on his spinners early.

Left-hander  Yuveraj Singh, probably the hardest striker  of  the 
ball  in  the championship, and Sodhi brought the  side  back  on 
track  with  a 49-run fifth-wicket stand as the  Lankan  spinners 
made  no  impression. Sodhi and the dapper southpaw  Niraj  Patel 
then  took  the team past the 200-run mark with an  89-run  fifth 
wicket  stand,  the  feature  being  their  running  between  the 
wickets. 

Sri  Lanka made an exciting start when opener  Weeraratne  pulled 
Salabh  Srivastava for a six off the first ball of  the  innings. 
The  top-order  played some attractive shots, but  none  had  the 
heart to stay leaving the team tottering at 76 for five. 

India  came  up with a much improved  fielding  performance.  The 
bowlers too did a good job except during the phase when it became 
defensive.  Off-spinner  Venugopala Rao was warned again  not  to 
bowl  the faster delivery and according to informed  sources,  he  
would not bowl in the ensuing matches and play only as a batsman.

Pieris and Lokuarachchi put on 57 for the seven wicket to  enable 
Sri Lanka stay in the chase before the latter played on to  left-
arm spinner Yuveraj Singh. Pieris continued the good work but the 
writing on the wall was clear. 

Pakistan  defeated  the West Indies at the Colombo  Cricket  Club 
ground  to  record  its third straught win  while  Tim  Welford's 
allround show enabled Australia beat New Zealand in Moratuwa  for 
its  second win. West Indies finished third with one victory  and 
New Zealand fourth with no points.
