Scorpio


Sun sign Scorpio (Oct. 23 to Nov. 22)

Finances may be in short supply. You may be forced to locate tidy 
sums   to  take  care  of  repairs  to  vehicles  and   property. 
Speculation  is not advised. New ventures may take time  to  turn 
the  corner.  Let  those romantically  inclined  be  careful  and 
discreet.  Do  not worry if a child, a friend, a  relative  or  a 
business  associate  is  lukewarm;  deal  with  them   patiently.  
Politicians must be wary of even close associates.

Artists and the women are well-set to flourish. Financial matters 
will  move  to your advantage. Taking part in races  and  lottery 
will  not  fetch  you any rewards. Your father  may  suffer  some 
health  problem  or  witness a setback  in  his  career.  Support 
offered by close relatives, friends and associates at work may be 
nil. A transfer is on the cards for some government servants  and 
those in the uniformed services.
