Realtors  move  ahead slowly. Opponents, both known  and  secret, 
will  meet  defeat  at your hands. Celebrations  are  around  the 
corner. Finances will rule steady and reasonable gains will  come 
from  speculation  too. Warm reciprocation  will  greet  romantic 
moves.  Young  ones  are  due  to  secure  admission  in  foreign 
universities.   Business  associates  will  respond  well  to   a 
suggestion.
