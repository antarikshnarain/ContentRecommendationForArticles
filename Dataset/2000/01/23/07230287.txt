Jadeja gets a chance; no problems for North 


By Our Sports Reporter

VADODARA, JAN. 22. Amit Bhandari and Vikram Rathour were the main 
performers,  but Ajay Jadeja still hogged the attention in  North 
Zone's facile seven-wicket triumph over East Zone, in the Deodhar 
Trophy match at the IPCL Stadium here on Saturday.

Jadeja's participation had looked uncertain as various states  of 
North  objected  to his inclusion since he was  not  an  original 
choice.

North  manager  Mr. Suresh Luthra received telephone  calls  from 
various  officials of the zone, including Delhi District  Cricket 
Association  (DDCA) vice-president Mr. Chetan Chauhan,  Board  of 
Control  for  Cricket in India (BCCI) vice-  president  Mr.  C.K. 
Khanna  and  National selector Madan Lal. It  was  gathered  that 
`most'  of  the  North  states had  been  taken  into  confidence 
regarding  the matter, except Mr. Sunil Dev, the zonal  selection 
committee convenor.

North put the opposition in on a wet turf and took the field with 
10  players, Jadeja's name figuring in the 11. With just an  over 
gone,  Jadeja arrived, after Robin Singh had disposed  of  Nikhil 
Haldipur  with a lovely delivery that moved away from  the  left-
hander.  East lost wickets at regular intervals, Jadeja  chipping 
in  with  two-opener Shiv Sundar Das and No.  3  Rohan  Gavaskar, 
using a fairly new ball.

By bowling eight overs, Jadeja proved his fitness in the presence 
of  National selection committee chairman Chandu Borde  and  BCCI 
Secretary  Mr.  J.Y. Lele. Though Jadeja did not make  many  runs 
later  in the match, he had done his bit by fielding swiftly  and 
throwing from the deep as well.

The  best  bowler  for North was Robin's  new-ball  partner  Amit 
Bhandari,  who claimed three wickets, conceding just 15  runs  in 
his 10 overs. Moving the ball both ways, Bhandari induced an edge 
from Pravanjan Mullick, had Saba Karim caught by Virender  Sehwag 
at  gully  and later dismissed Utpal Chatterjee, who  played  on. 
Apart from the three wickets, Bhandari also had the other batsmen 
in  knots. Das, in particular, was beaten time and again  outside 
the off-stump.

Sanjay  Raul's 53 off 72 deliveries, which came with the help  of 
six  fours, helped East reach 166. Punjab  off-spinner  Sarandeep 
Singh  bagged three wickets, including that of Raul,  luring  the 
batsmen with well-flighted deliveries.

With the pitch playing better, North had no problem in getting to 
the  total. Vikram Rathour struck 70 off 91 balls, with the  help 
of  nine fours and a six. He played some characteristic shots  on  
the on-side and executed a few good square-cuts too.
