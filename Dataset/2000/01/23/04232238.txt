MDMK not to contest by-elections 


By Our Staff Reporter

NAGERCOIL,  JAN. 22. The MDMK General Secretary, Mr.  Vaiko,  has 
stated  that his party would not contest the coming  by-elections 
in the State. 

Mr.  Vaiko said his party had resolved not to contest but  strive 
under  the leadership of the DMK for the success of the  National 
Democratic Alliance (NDA) members.

Reiterating that he would never demand for himself a berth in the 
Central  Ministry, Mr. Vaiko said he would stick to his  decision 
and  would decline to accept any post offered to him. Mr.  Vaiko, 
however,  expressed  gratitude to the Prime Minister, Mr.  A.  B. 
Vajpayee, for accommodating two of his party MPs in the Cabinet. 

Claiming  his  relationship  with  the  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  M. 
Karunanidhi, was very cordial and smooth and that the latter  did 
not   show  any  disregard  to  him  on  any  issue,  Mr.   Vaiko 
categorically ruled out the possibility of his party merging with 
the  DMK  on any grounds. The MDMK, he asserted, would  not  only 
continue  to maintain it's identity but also strive for a  common 
cause of the NDA with the DMK.

On  the  wrongful  confinement  of 19  Tamil  Nadu  fishermen  in 
Pakistan prison, Mr. Vaiko assured to persuade the Prime Minister 
and the External Affairs Minister to take immediate measures  and 
liberate  the  fishermen, once the Parliament  session  began  on 
January 27. 

The High Court's verdict in the TANSI case was not the final word 
yet as the State Government had moved the Supreme Court.  Denying 
that there was any difference of opinion with the PMK, Mr.  Vaiko 
said the PMK was not drifting away and would remain as an  active 
constituent of the NDA. The Tamil Maanila Congress had run  short 
of  issues to take on the NDA and hence was hunting  for  excuses 
for staging agitations, he said.
