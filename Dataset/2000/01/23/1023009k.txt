Capricorn


Sun sign Capricorn (Dec. 21 to Jan. 19)

Promotion  and a welcome shift are certain for those  in  defence 
and police. Some progress will be seen by dealers in real estate. 
Commission traders, students and professionals must learn to keep 
their  cool as they run into obstacles. Ill-health or a hitch  in 
studies  could  trouble  young ones in the  family.  Some  health 
problem may affect women in the family way also. Do not tie  your 
money to numbers on the dice or horses' tails. Financial  inflows  
will be sufficient for day-to-day demands. 

Moon  in MAKARA (Stars - the last three quarters of  Uttarashada, 
Sravana and the first two quarters of Dhanishta)

Finances have to be managed efficiently. Repairs to vehicles  and 
maintenance  of house may cause a dent in money matters.  Careful 
borrowing  is  advised.  Shun speculation  entirely.  Secrecy  is 
essential  for  you  to put  through  important  plans.  Business 
persons must slash heavy inventories and maintain their  accounts 
up-to-date. Politicians will do well to keep a low profile. 

Chandrashtama:  Continuing  from last week to 3-42  a.m.  on  the 
night of January 24/25.
