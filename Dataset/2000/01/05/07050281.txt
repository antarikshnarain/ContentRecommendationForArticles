It is Laxman's turn to play 'Lone Ranger' 


By Vijay Lokapally

SYDNEY,  JAN. 4. He went down with guns blazing, and most  humbly 
dedicated  his  knock to the team and his dear  ones.  In  V.V.S. 
Laxman's  grand performance at the SCG, a touch artist  was  born 
and  he  might  have been lost to Indian  cricket  but  for  this 
symphony on Tuesday.

The Indians lost by an innings and 141 runs as Glenn McGrath took 
his match tally to 10 wickets, but Laxman resurrected his  career 
with a remarkably polished innings which belonged to the  highest 
class.

Australia  won  the series 3-0 and this match with  two  days  to 
spare.  If  the  battle was extended it  was  purely  because  of 
Laxman's batsmanship.

India's cricketing image stood sullied by another timid surrender 
but  from the ruins emerged Laxman, a much under- rated  batsman. 
He now awaits justice. Even as India slid to another  humiliating 
defeat, he dazzled with the bat, scoring his maiden century in 17 
Tests. But what a pity. The selectors have summoned him back.

``We'll  see  if  we can have a word with the  Board.  He  surely 
deserves to be here. I'll be very happy to have him here,''  said 
Tendulkar on the possibility of Laxman staying back for the  rest 
of the tour.

Kapil Dev agreed. ``We'll make a request to the Board to allow us 
to have Laxman for the one-day series. He batted like a  champion 
today.  He reminded me so much of Azharuddin,'' said  the  Indian 
coach.

Laxman,  25,  blasted  hundred-plus in a  session  with  masterly 
strokeplay.  He demonstrated every shot in the book  with  silken 
grace and emphatic force as he took the fight to the  opposition. 
His  show  pushed into the background some good work  earlier  by 
Justin  Langer,  who  made his first double  century,  and  Ricky 
Ponting.

The   Aussies  in  the  stands  stood  and   applauded   Laxman's 
achievement.  Steve Waugh walked up to the genial Hyderabadi  and 
offered   warm  congratulations.  ``It  was  the  most   stunning 
strokeplay seen this summer,'' praised the Australian skipper.

Struck  on the visor by Glenn McGrath, the mild- mannered  Laxman 
took  little time to recover and played some astounding shots  in 
front of the wicket. He whipped Brett Lee across the line as  the 
bowler went for 52 runs in five overs. Laxman also punished  `man 
of the match' McGrath and Fleming with powerful cover-drives. All 
shots  worthy  of  a limited-overs innings and  Laxman  was  only  
proving  a point that he had the calibre to create it in  a  Test 
arena.

It  was the most entertaining innings of the series no doubt.  It 
had quality written all over and every cracking shot from his bat 
must  have  caused certain discomfort to at least five  men  back 
home.

What  one liked was the manner in which he stood on his toes  and 
smashed  the bowlers behind square. No other Indian  batsman  had 
shown such courage against the fast men on this tour, and against 
Shane Warne too. Watching Laxman step out to Warne was a delight, 
as  were his well-timed flicks and a couple of  crashing  bended-
knee square-drives.

In  the  morning, Langer prolonged the misery of the  bowlers  by 
hitting and missing and edging his way to a double century  while 
Ponting  continued his wonderful domination of the Indian  attack 
with his second century of the series.

Australia  declared having swelled the first innings lead to  402 
runs.  It  reminded  one of the Calcutta Test in  1998  when  the 
Aussies suffered a similar embarrassment at the Eden Gardens.  It 
was  a  declaration well-timed by Steve Waugh since it  gave  his 
bowlers, fresh and hungry, to tear into a tiring opposition.

Lack of will to fight

The  lack of will to fight among the Indian ranks  was  shocking. 
That  some were ill-equipped technically was  understandable  but 
not  the likes of Rahul Dravid, who perished to McGrath  for  the 
second time in the match, to complete a miserable run in the Test 
series.

The  ill-advised move to open with a makeshift option once  again 
jolted  India  early  in its second innings.  M.S.K.  Prasad  had 
nothing  to  offer and finished with an awful match.  The  22-run 
stand was India's best opening partnership in six innings.

Tendulkar  was back on the field in a matter of seven  overs  and 
lasted just four deliveries. He swung the first ball from McGrath 
for a majestic boundary but it was not a good sign. It must  have 
been tough for the Indian skipper to concentrate, what with  some 
of  his  trusted men deserting him. So when he punched  the  ball 
straight  to covers, one was not surprised.  Tendulkar,  adjudged 
the `man of the series', also could succumb to pressure.

Once  Tendulkar fell, India's hopes sank. Wickets  kept  tumbling 
and  Laxman  increased the pace of his run-making.  He  lost  the 
inconsistent Ganguly, shaky Hrishikesh Kanitkar, determined  Anil 
Kumble  and an incredibly jinxed Ajit Agarkar, who collected  his 
fifth  zero in a row. When Laxman finally fell, in fading  light, 
the crowd rose to a man. The last batsman got out in a clumsy run 
out and Vijay Bharadwaj could not bat due to a spasm in the lower 
back. It did not matter as Indian cricket stood crippled  despite  
the  gallant  efforts of Laxman and Tendulkar.  Australia  was  a 
clear and worthy winner in every aspect of the game.

To  add  to India's woes, the team was fined 10 per cent  of  its 
match fee for bowling two overs short.
