Stocks remain volatile, Sensex hits historic high


MUMBAI,  JAN.  4. Equities sustained their rally for  the  second 
successive  day  and lifted the benchmark to another  a  historic 
high  at  5534 during extremely volatile trading  on  the  Bombay 
Stock  Exchange  today  as  speculators  continued  to  cheer   a 
triumphant  transition to the new millennium, anticipating  sharp 
increase in foreign investments in the country.

Operators flooded the market with the very funds they had  raised 
out of the Y2K jitters and were extending commitments in  several 
scrips  as foreign institutional investors and  Indian  financial 
institutions  made fresh purchases in software scrips and  select 
cyclicals.

Fresh FII activity was attributed to the persistent rally in  the 
Nasdaq composite index that scaled a new peak at 4131.1 at  close 
on  Monday.  Once  again, Infosys Technologies jumped  to  a  new 
record high at Rs. 16931.65 during the session.

The  BSE  sensitive index opened with a wide gap at  5533.98  but 
later  fluctuated  erratically  in a wide range  of  5533.98  and 
5376.43  before  closing  with a new record  at  5491.01  against  
yesterday's close of 5375.11, netting a rise of 115.90 points.
