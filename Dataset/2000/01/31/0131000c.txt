Musharraf ready to meet Vajpayee


NEW  DELHI,  JAN.  30. Terming  Indo-Pakistan  relations  at  its 
``lowest'',  Pakistan's  military ruler, Gen.  Pervez  Musharraf, 
today  said  he was ready to meet the Prime Minister, Mr.  A.  B. 
Vajpayee,  provided that ``centrality'' of the Kashmir issue  was 
accepted.

``Yes,  as  long  as the centrality of  the  Kashmir  dispute  is 
accepted and we are prepared to initiate a dialogue and there  is 
reciprocity  on  Kashmir,'' Mr. Musharraf said when asked  in  an 
interview whether he was willing to meet Mr. Vajpayee.

Asked  if Indo-Pakistan ties had gone from bad to worse, he  said 
``yes, they are more dangerous now. Our relations with India  are 
at  the lowest''. He accused the media of creating an  atmosphere 
of ``hysteria and hatred'' among the two countries.

On  the hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane and  reports  that 
the hijackers were currently in Pakistan, Mr. Musharraf told Star 
World's `Focus Asia' programme ``I don't know at all that this is 
a fact. They disappeared from Afghanistan.... And I presume they 
are  in Afghanistan.''   Asked to comment on New  Delhi's  demand 
for declaring Pakistan a terrorist State, he said ``we are not  a 
terrorist State. They (India) have been trying to brand us as one 
since long''.

``Now lately, they have got a good excuse of the hijacking  which 
they  are  pinning on us which is absolutely  wrong  again,''  he 
said. 

On Kashmir, Mr. Musharraf said ``this is the dispute. This is the 
cause  of  tension.... This is what can lead to a  war.  We  can 
surely  discuss these issues bilaterally or mediated by  a  third 
party,'' he said in a significant statement.

To  a  question on whether he would declare a  ``no-first-  use'' 
policy  on  nuclear weapons, he said ``nobody in his  right  mind 
will  use  nuclear  weapons.... Our  weapons  are  to  be  used 
absolutely  as  the  last resolve. I hope  and  pray  that  never 
happens''.

On  restoration  of democracy in Pakistan, he said he  could  not 
provide  a time-frame but ``I can say I am laying the  objectives 
and objective limits'' for that.

On the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton's visit to south Asia, he 
said  ``we would love him to come to Pakistan. There is no  doubt 
in that and indicators from our side could be given.... They are 
being given.`` 

Stating  that  he  would be visiting Afghanistan  soon,  he  said 
``obviously, I am going to talk about issues. We will talk on the  
Afghan  issue in totality as also Osama bin Laden and  also  army 
training camps for terrorists in Afghanistan''.

He said the Afghan Foreign Minister had recently visited Pakistan 
and  the Afghan President was expected to follow this  month-end. 
He said he would visit Kabul shortly after that.
