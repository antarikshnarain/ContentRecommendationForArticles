JCT holds Churchill 


LUDHIANA,  JAN. 30. JCT held Churchill Brothers to a 1-1 draw  in 
the concluding match of the first phase of the National  Football 
League (NFL) at the Guru Nanak stadium here on Sunday.

JCT  took the lead in the 18th minute through midfielder  Hardeep 
Sangha, whose powerful left-footer from the top of the box sailed 
into the goal with the rival defence caught off guard.

Churchill  equalised  in  the 65th minute  when  Marcus  Carvalho 
headed home a flick from Ukrainian midfielder Andry Malchevsky.

Churchill Brothers now top the NFL table with 23 points while JCT 
is fourth with 17 points.

After JCT took the lead through Sangha, who later suffered a  leg 
injury  and  was  replaced by Jasbir Singh  in  the  first  half, 
Churchill counter-attacked through Rockey Baretto and Malchevsky. 

Malchevsky  came close to scoring once but his angular shot  from 
the left sailed over the bar.

A  few minutes before half-time, Carvalho netted the ball  off  a 
counter-attack but was ruled off-side.

In  the 65th minute, Malchevsky flicked the ball near the  danger 
zone and Carvahlo beat JCT custodian Baljit Singh. 

JCT  made  a  couple of substitutions after  the  equaliser  with 
Harinder Singh replacing Harjinder Singh and Jaswant Singh coming 
in  for Hardeep Gill, but the moves failed to yield  the  desired 
result.

The second phase of NFL commences on February 1.
