Naidu denies threat to Vizag power project


DAVOS,  JAN.  30.  The  Andhra Pradesh  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  N. 
Chandrababu Naidu, has said that there was no threat to the Vizag 
power  project but asserted that the interests of  the  consumers 
would  not be allowed to be compromised while finding a  solution 
to remove the bottlenecks in setting up this thermal station.

``Negotiations are under way to thrash out differences related to 
power  purchase  agreement  (PPA) and we have  to  wait  for  the 
outcome before knowing the fate of the project,'' Mr. Naidu  told 
PTI yesterday in an interview on the sidelines of the 30th annual 
meeting of the World Economic Forum here.

Naidu,   who  is  attending  the  WEF  meeting  for  the   second 
consecutive year, said the people of Andhra Pradesh could not  be 
allowed  to  be  burdened  with  any  new  power  projects  where 
electricity  costs are very expensive than those of the  existing 
power utilities.

Economic  reforms package must be to the advantage of the  common 
man. ``I have to carry the people's interests with me while going 
in for economic reforms,'' he said. 

Pointing  out  that the 1,040 MW Vizag thermal project  had  been 
hanging  fire for ``several reasons'', he did not give any  time-
frame  as to how long it would take for the project to take  off. 
Plans for the project to be executed by National Power of Britain 
and the Hinduja group were in the pipeline for nearly six years.

The  promoters of the Vizag project have reportedly put  together 
the project financing and are ready for financial closure.

In  reply to a question, the Chief Minister said issues  relating 
to  the escrow account for the Vizag project could be sorted  out 
as  and when the PPA was finalised between the  State  Government 
and the project promoters. 

Governments  are usually asked to open escrow accounts to  ensure 
that the power company is able to collect its dues from the State 
Electricity Board.
