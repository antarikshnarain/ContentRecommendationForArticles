Sarvodaya leader rejects award


By Our Staff Reporter

THANJAVUR,  JAN.  30. A Sarvodaya leader and  chairman  of  Grama 
Swarajya  Movement,  Mr. S. Jagannathan, who has been  running  a 
campaign  against prawn farms in the Cauvery delta  districts  of 
Tamil Nadu, has refused to accept the Padma Shri awarded to him.

Replying  to the intimation that he had been given the  award  by 
the Under-Secretary, Home Department, Tamil Nadu Government, over 
the  phone  and the subsequent telegram sent by  the  Union  Home 
Minister, Mr. L.K. Advani, congratulating him for the award,  Mr. 
Jagannathan, said that the British rulers started the practice of 
awarding  titles to distinguished persons. India should  give  up 
this bureaucratic ceremonial awards.

The  country was in the grip of communal and caste  violence  and 
the Independence and Republic days had to be held in the midst of 
violent  threats.  Poverty  alleviation  and  mitigation  of  the 
disparity between the rich and the poor were also a far cry.  The 
national leaders were stunned by these problems. In this critical 
situation,  the  granting of awards like Padma Shri  etc.  was  a 
misnomer and misfit, Mr. Jagannathan said.

Finally, the paradoxical conflict between judiciary and executive 
was undermining democracy. The Supreme Court had ruled all  prawn 
farms should be closed down by the end of March 1997.

Under  the pressure of multinational prawn companies, a move  was 
made to introduce in the Rajya Sabha during the Deve Gowda regime 
the  Aquaculture  Authority Bill to nullify  the  judgement.  The 
Prime  Minister, Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, who was then  the  Opposition 
leader had said his party would stoutly oppose the Bill.

Mr.  Jagannathan appealed to Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Advani to  take 
immediate steps to close down all prawn farms at least by end  of 
March 2000.
