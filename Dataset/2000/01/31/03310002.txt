No warrant for warning, says Pak.


ISLAMABAD,  JAN.  30. Pakistan has rejected an  apparent  warning 
from the United States that it could be branded as ``a sponsor of 
terrorism'',  saying  there was ``no warrant for  any  warning''. 
``In  Pakistan  there  is legitimate sympathy  with  the  Kashmir 
people... the legitimate Kashmiri struggle cannot be  described 
as  terrorist  activity...  official Pakistani  agencies  do  not 
provide  any support to the religious organisations  involved  in 
insurgency,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.

Quoted  by the English daily The News, the statement  added  that 
``we (Pakistan) believe in the peaceful negotiation process.'' It 
comes  in  the  wake of comments by  the  U.S.  State  Department 
spokesman, Mr. James Rubin that Islamabad was sheltering Kashmiri 
militant group, Harkat-Ul Mujahideen and others.

Claiming  that  Islamabad had been an ally of Washington  in  the 
battle  against  terrorism, the statement  cited  extradition  of 
suspects,  allegedly involved in the bombing of the  World  Trade 
Centre  in  New York and attack on U.S. embassies in  Africa,  as 
examples to support its stand.
