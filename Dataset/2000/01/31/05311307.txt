No, it's safe


Sir, - Apropos of the letter on `polio vaccine risks' (The Hindu, 
Jan.  27),  the  American Academy  of  Paediatrics  modified  the 
schedule  only  after  October 1998 in  view  of  the  increasing 
incidence  of immuno-suppressed children  including  HIV-infected 
ones. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is recommended only for the 
first  two  doses  and oral polio vaccine  (OPV)  for  subsequent 
doses.  The advisory committee on immunisation practices  of  the 
U.S.  still  recommends OPV for mass immunisation  in  developing 
countries  to control outbreaks caused by the wild  polio  virus. 
The  incidence  of polio has dramatically come down in  the  past 
three years in Tamil Nadu and the schedule followed at present is 
quite adequate to eradicate polio.

Safety,  efficacy and administrative overheads are all in  favour 
of  OPV  as  the effective vaccine to eradicate  polio  from  the 
community.
