Courts arrest


By Sujay Mehdudia

NEW DELHI, JAN. 30. The Congress(I) president, Ms. Sonia  Gandhi, 
along  with  CWC  members, legislators  and  councillors  courted 
arrest  at Tees January Marg here today while proceeding  towards 
the   Prime   Minister's  residence  to   protest   against   the 
``saffronisation'' of the bureaucracy in Gujarat and the move  to 
review the Constitution. 

It  was the first time that Ms. Sonia Gandhi had courted  arrest, 
and  the  second  time she had led a  protest  march.  The  show, 
however, left much to be desired. It reflected the failure of the 
local Congress leadership, as well as other leaders, to  mobilise 
workers. 

Earlier  in the morning, senior leaders and workers assembled  at 
the party headquarters at 24, Akbar Road. This was followed by  a 
tribute  of bhajans to the father of the nation on his  martyrdom 
day.  Ms.  Gandhi then administered a pledge to  the  Congress(I) 
workers  to uphold the nation's integrity and unity and work  for 
the betterment of Dalits, women, backward classes and minorities.

The march to the Prime Minister's residence was led by Ms. Gandhi 
who  was surrounded by senior party leaders. The entire route  to 
the  Tees  January  Marg was virtually  taken  over  by  security 
personnel.
