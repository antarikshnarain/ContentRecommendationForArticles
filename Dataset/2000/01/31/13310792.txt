A dream come true


YES,  IT is a dream come true. Swami Vivekananda's vision,  Swami 
Ramakrishnananda's efforts and the prayers of the devotees of Sri 
Ramakrishna    Math,   Mylapore,   have   contributed   to    the 
transformation  of dream into reality - the Universal  Temple  of 
Sri Ramakrishna.

This  temple,  aimed at bringing about a  social  revolution,  is 
dedicated to Sri Ramakrishna, a symbol of Universal religion. The 
speciality  of  the  Chennai temple is that it  blends  with  the 
tradition  of  South Indian temple architecture.  A  7-feet  tall 
white marble image of Sri Ramakrishna, like the one in the  Belur 
Math temple, seated on a carved marble lotus, has been  installed 
at the centre of the shrine.

With   smaller  sub-shrines  for  Sri  Sarada  Devi   and   Swami 
Vivekananda,  and a magnificent main entrance built with  ancient 
Dravidian architecture, the Universal Temple will be  consecrated 
on February 7. The temple ceremony will be on from February 5  to 
February 12, 2000.

An architectural beauty, this temple is not for any sect, but for 
all,  which is a standing invitation for those who want  to  seek 
self-knowledge.
