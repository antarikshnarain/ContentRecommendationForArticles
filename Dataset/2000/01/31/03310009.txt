Pak. out of joint with times: Britain


LONDON,  JAN. 30. The British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin  Cook, 
severely castigated the military coup in Pakistan saying ``it  is 
out of joint with the times.'' 

Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs here  on 
Friday on ``foreign policy and national interest,'' Mr. Cook said 
democracy has made major gains in the past decade. 

``In Europe, the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have  chosen 
democracy. There are no military juntas left in Latin America. In 
1975,  only  three Heads of State in Africa were  chosen  through 
elections. In 1999, there were 32,'' he said. 

Britain  supported human rights and democracy for others  because 
``these are values we demand for ourselves,'' Mr. Cook said.  The 
Foreign Secretary also emphasised the need for reforming the U.N. 
Security Council. 

Noting  that Governments which respect freedom of expression  are 
more  likely  to provide the transparency to  be  secure  trading 
partners, Mr. Cook said,``countries which observe the rule of law 
at home are more likely to accept their international obligations 
to  fight  drugs  trade or halt weapons  proliferation.  We  will 
therefore  take  every  realistic,  responsible  step  to  pursue 
diplomacy for democracy.''
