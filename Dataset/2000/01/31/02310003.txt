BJP, BJD release list of candidates


By Our Staff Correspondent

BHUBANESWAR,  JAN. 30.Putting an end to several rounds of  hectic 
parleys in the past several days the BJP-Biju Janata Dal alliance 
tonight  released the names of their candidates for 147  Assembly 
seats in Orissa. The BJP is contesting in 63 seats and BJD in 84.

Tomorrow  is the last date for filing the nomination  papers  for 
the  70  seats which are scheduled to go to polls  in  the  first 
phase  on  February 17. The remaining 77 seats would  go  to  the 
polls on February 22.

The announcement of the names at the last minute, however,further 
exposed the fact that the leaders of the two parties were finding 
it  tough to sort out their differences. The leaders had to  keep 
themselves  busy  from early morning till late in  the  night  to 
decide which seats would go to which member of the alliance.

It  was only on Saturday evening that the alliance  leaders  were 
able to reach an agreement over seat-sharing issue. It was agreed 
that the BJD would contest in 84 seats and the BJP 63 as per  the 
12-9 arrangement which was followed in the two general  elections 
in  the  past. Out of 21 Lok Sabha seats in the  State,  the  BJD 
contested  in  12 seats and BJP had fought in 9  in  the  general 
elections held in 1998 and 1999.

Of  the 70 seats which are going to the polls in the first  phase 
the BJP would contest in 35 segments and the BJD in the remaining 
35.  In the second phase, the BJP would contest 28 seats and  BJD 
49.

Almost  everyone in the BJP camp is jubilant since Saturday  when 
the  BJD  agreed  to contest from 84  seats.  The  BJD  Political 
Affairs  Committee  had  initially demanded 122  seats  as  their 
share.

It was stated that the BJD leaders delayed formal announcement of 
the  names today as they feared reaction from their party  cadres 
who are sore over the seat-sharing arrangements.
