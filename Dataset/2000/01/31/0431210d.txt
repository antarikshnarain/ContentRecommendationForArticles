Uncle holds child to Rs. 3-lakh ransom


By Our Staff Reporter

BANGALORE,  JAN.  30. A three- year-old boy  has  been  allegedly 
kidnapped  from Rajajinagar police limits in Bangalore,  and  the 
abductor, suspected to be the boy's uncle, has threatened to kill 
the boy if his parents fail to pay him Rs. 3 lakhs.

Police  said  that  Krishna, the youngest son of  Mr.  Kalyan,  a 
marble slab fixing contractor, was found missing from their house 
in Prakashnagar 8th Main on January 24 at about 5.30 p.m.

Rajajinagar police registered a ``missing'' case the same day and 
were  searching for the boy. However, on Saturday afternoon,  the 
abductor  allegedly  made  a  telephone  call  to  Mr.   Kalyan's 
brother's  house, and the woman, who received the phone call  was 
told by the caller that Krishna was in his custody.

The caller threatened to kill the boy if Mr. Kalyan failed to pay 
him Rs. 3 lakhs. The woman, who received the call, said the voice 
of  the  caller  was similar to that of Pehalad,  a  relative  of 
theirs, Mr. Kalyan told the police.

It  is  said that Pehalad (27), who was married to  Mr.  Kalyan's 
sister-in-law,  was working with him. Due to his bad conduct,  he 
was thrown out about two months ago, Mr. Kalyan told police.

It  is also said that Pehalad had come to Mr. Kalyan's  house  on 
January  24.  Mr. Kalyan's wife did not allow  Pehalad  into  the 
house as her husband was not at home.

Mr.  Kalyan's  family hails from Gwalior in Madhya  Pradesh,  and 
police  suspect  that  Pehalad may be there.  A  team  of  police 
officials  has been sent to Madhya Pradesh. However, police  said 
they  were  not  sure  whether  Pehalad  was  in  Gwalior  or  in 
Bangalore.

What  is  intriguing the police is that though Mr. Kalyan  has  a 
telephone at his residence, the ``abductor'' had chosen to make a 
call to his brother's house.
