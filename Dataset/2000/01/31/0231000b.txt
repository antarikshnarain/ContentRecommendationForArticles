'BJP trying to weaken democracy'


By Our Special Correspondent

LUCKNOW,  JAN. 30. The Bahujan Samaj Party leader, Ms.  Mayawati, 
today said the Baharatiya Janata Party- led Government's plans to 
review  the  Constitution  were part of  a  wider  conspiracy  to 
implement its hidden agenda.

Talking  to  newspersons  here, she said the BJP  was  trying  to 
weaken  the  elements  of democracy and  thrust  its  concept  of 
Hinduism on the country. The Constitution-makers had prepared the 
document after a long deliberation. Provisions for amendments  to 
the Constitution were inherent to it and this made any review  of 
the  Constitution unnecessary. The BJP was, however, going  ahead 
with  its designs in a brazen manner. This was a clear  challenge 
to  the wisdom of Constitution makers like Dr. Babasaheb  Bhimrao 
Ambedker, she felt.

Expressing her party's determination not to tolerate any fiddling 
with the Constitution, she said the BJP was creating dangers  for 
the  very  existence of people believing in  non-Hindu  religions 
with its talks of Constitutional review.

On  the  recent  statement by the U.P. Chief  Minister,  Mr.  Ram 
Prakash Gupta, on construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya,  Ms. 
Mayawati said it was very serious in as much as it was a kind  of 
interference  with the affairs of the judiciary which was  seized 
of the issue. 

She  announced that the former MP from Azamgarh, Mr. Akber  Ahmed 
``Dumpy'' would be her party nominee for the Lok Sabha byelection 
from  Kannauj constituency. She also announced  other  candidates 
for  Assembly  byelections - Mr. Shiv Kumar  Saini  (Nakud),  Mr. 
Surendra  Kumar  (Shahabad), Mr. Amjad  Hussain  (Pilibhit),  Mr. 
Riyasuddin  Hashmi (Unnao), Mr. Lal Bahadur  Singh  (Pratapgarh), 
Mr.  Jaib  Maije (Gauribazar), Mr. Parwez Ali (Patiali)  and  Mr. 
Shiv Kumar Kashyap (Thana Bhawan).
