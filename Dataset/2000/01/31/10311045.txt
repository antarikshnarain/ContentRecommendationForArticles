dated January 31, 1950: Responsibilities of freedom


Dr. C. R. Reddi, Pro-Chancellor of Mysore University, addressed a 
large gathering of college students and professors and lecturers, 
in connection with the celebration of Indian Republic, on January 
28,  at the Maharaja's College. He explained the significance  of 
the day and the duties and responsibilities that the people  were 
called  upon  to  discharge not only in the  maintenance  of  the 
freedom  but also in enabling this Sovereign Democratic  Republic 
of India, to play her part as a great factor in the establishment 
of world peace.

Dr.  Reddi  emphasised that it was a day  of  unique  importance. 
First,  it  was the day of the celebration of  a  great  historic 
event;  secondly, it was a day of dedication by the  citizens  of 
India  for  the  task ahead of them; thirdly, it  was  a  day  of 
commemoration  of the great people, of organisations of  persons, 
men  and women, who had fought for their progress; and  fourthly, 
it  was a day of commiseration for the unfortunate people,  those 
millions  of the homeless and the shelterless, undergoing  untold 
sufferings.

Dr.  Reddi observed that hitherto Great Britain, with  her  army, 
navy,  and  air force stood guarantee for their  safety  and  the 
safety  of the country against external aggression  and  internal 
commotion.  Now, the task of defending the country had fallen  on 
their own shoulders. Eternal vigilance and constant efforts  were 
required to maintain the freedom. It depended on the unity of the 
country  and her strength. Sardar Patel had achieved wonders  and 
miracles, in a way to bring about a geographical unity. But human 
integration was necessary.
