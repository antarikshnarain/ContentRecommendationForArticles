Moopanar to make statement today


By Our Staff Reporter

CHENNAI, JAN. 30. The TMC President, Mr. G. K. Moopanar, has said 
that  he  will make a detailed statement tomorrow  on  the  stand 
taken by his party to support the AIADMK candidates in the  three 
by-elections for the Assembly on February 17.

Mr. Moopanar was responding to questions from presspersons on the 
TMC  Whip,  Mr.  R. Chokkar, resigning his MLA  post  in  protest 
against the decision of the TMC to support the AIADMK here today.

He also parried a question whether the objective on which the TMC 
was formed (to fight AIADMK's corruption) had become  irrelevant. 
Nor  would  he  go  into  reports  of  the  TMC  leader,  Mr.  P. 
Chidambaram, of being unhappy over the party's decision.

``I will meet you tomorrow and respond to your queries'' was  all 
that Mr. Moopanar would say.
