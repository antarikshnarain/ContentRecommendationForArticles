I have forgiven Dara Singh, says Gladys


MUMBAI, JAN. 30. `My only desire is that Dara Singh does not kill 
any  more and stops fighting against God', said  Gladys  Staines, 
the wife of slain Australian missionary Graham Staines.

`I  have forgiven him', Gladys said of Dara Singh, who  allegedly 
burnt alive her husband and two sons in Manoharpur in Orissa last 
year  and added in a choked voice that `forgiveness opens up  the 
path of healing'. Gladys, clad in a blue sari and accompanied  by 
her daughter Esther, attended the book release function of `Burnt 
alive: the Staines and the God they loved' at Jaihind College  in 
south Mumbai this evening.

The  book  has been jointly authored by Vishal  Magalwadi,  Vijay 
Martis, M. B. Desai, Babu K. Verghese and Radha Samuel.

Earlier  talking to mediapersons, Gladys, on the  year  following 
Graham's  death, said `It has been a difficult year but by  God's 
grace we have sustained it'.

On  why  she  chose to stay in India instead  of  going  back  to 
Australia,  she said `I made a choice to stay back since  running 
away from a situation is not an answer to it'.

Besides  `love  of  the  local people, who  have  backed  me  and 
completion of Graham's dream of a hospital for lepers', were  the 
other reasons which made her stay.
