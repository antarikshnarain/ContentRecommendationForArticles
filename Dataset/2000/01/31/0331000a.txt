Colombo may get fresh weapons from U.S.


By V.S. Sambandan

COLOMBO,  JAN. 30. Sri Lanka appears set for days of  intensified 
military  operations, with reports saying that the Government  is 
likely to acquire fresh defence equipment from the U.S., and  the 
LTTE is preparing for a ``major offensive.''

Observers  feel  that  with the  Independence  Day  (February  4) 
nearing,  the  Tigers may launch another attack in  the  northern 
sector,  probably the crucial Elephant Pass Army base, which  has 
not succumbed to the rebel onslaught. 

Reports  of  steps to get weapons from the U.S. appeared  in  the 
Sunday Times, which said that ``Washington has agreed to sell Sri 
Lanka  combat-related equipment under a multi-million dollar  new 
millennium  deal'' and that these include Hughes Mortar  locating 
devices said to be worth over $ 22 millions.'' 

The  other  equipment  which the island is said  to  acquire  are 
``three  brand-new Bell 412 helicopters,'' and ``the purchase  of 
high  calibre  ammunition  from a manufacturer in  Spain  who  is 
producing it under licence from the U.S.''

The report of weapons acquisition comes days after the Sri  Lanka 
army  announced  plans  to recruit 15,000 more  soldiers  in  the 
military operations against the LTTE.

16 injured in bus-blast

At least 16 persons were reportedly injured in an explosion in  a 
bus in Sri Lanka's north-western Kurunegala district.

Reports  said  that the bomb was planted in the  bus  headed  for 
Colombo and exploded at Polgahawela in Kurunegala district. A few 
days  ago,  a bomb exploded in the main post office  in  northern 
Vavuniya town.
