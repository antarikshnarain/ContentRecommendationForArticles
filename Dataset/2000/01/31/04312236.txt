By Our Special Correspondent

CHENNAI,  JAN. 30. The MGR-ADMK has nominated Mr.  C.  Anbarasan, 
Pudukottai  district secretary, as candidate in  the  by-election 
Aranthangi for Assembly constituency.

The  party general secretary, Mr. S. Thirunavukkarasu,  said  Mr. 
Anbarasan  had  emerged  as  the  consensus  candidate  among  40 
applicants.

Reacting to the TMC's decision to support the AIADMK, he said  it 
did not augur well for the TMC as it was formed in 1996 to  fight 
the AIADMK's corruption.

A joint campaign meeting of NDA partners will be held on February 
11 at Aranthangi.

The MGR-ADMK had formed separate committee for each of the  three 
constituencies, he added.
