CPI welcomes TMC decision


By Our Special Correspondent

TIRUCHI,  JAN.  30.  The  State secretary  of  the  CPI,  Mr.  R. 
Nallakkannu, has welcomed the decision of the TMC to support  the 
AIADMK  candidate in the by-elections to the State  Assembly.  He 
said that all secular forces should join hands to defeat the  NDA 
candidates in the elections.

Talking  to presspersons here today, he said that of  late  Tamil 
Nadu  Chief Minister, Mr. M. Karunanidhi, was blindly  supporting 
the  BJP,  which was very dangerous to the  country.  Though  the 
President of India himself had cautioned against a review of  the 
Indian  constitution,  the  BJP was keen to  go  ahead  with  the 
exercise. In fact it was one of the items in the hidden agenda of 
the BJP, he added.

The  CPI leader questioned the statement of the State  Irrigation 
Minister  that  Tamil Nadu had got much more water than  the  205 
tmcft  of  water  recommended in the  interim  award.  The  State 
received  copious  supply only during the floods  in  October  in 
Karnataka, and it did not get the quota fixed by the Tribunal for 
the crucial months of June, July, August, and September. It was a 
clear  example of the DMK supporting the NDA partner against  the 
interests of the people of the State, he said.
