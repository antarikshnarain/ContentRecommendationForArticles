'India is the only enemy' 


ISLAMABAD,  JAN.30.Sitting cross-legged beneath posters of  heavy 
machine guns, Maulana Fazl-Ur Rehman Khalil, chief of the Harkat-
ul-Mujahideen  (HuM), claims that his organisation has  only  one 
enemy, India, and it is waging Jehad (holy war) only in Kashmir. 

``We  are only fighting in Kashmir, we are not fighting  anywhere 
else, not in Chechnya, not anywhere but in Kashmir'', Khalil said 
yesterday in a rare interview at the organisation's office,  near 
Rawalpindi.  The U.S. has been pressurising Pakistani  Government 
to dismantle the organisation and has warned that Pakistan  could 
be  listed  as  a  terrorist state -  making  it  ineligible  for 
virtually all U.S. Aid - if it extended direct support to HuM.
