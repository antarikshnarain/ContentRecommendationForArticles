By Our Staff Reporter

RAMANATHAPURAM,  JAN. 30. The Pattali Makkal Katchi has  welcomed 
the  Tamil  Maanila  Congress  legislative  party  whip,  Mr.  R. 
Chokkar's  resignation from the MLA post protesting  against  the 
party's  decision  to  support the AIADMK  in  the  Assembly  by- 
elections.

Talking  to the mediapersons here today. The PMK founder, Dr.  S. 
Ramadoss,  said that other self-respecting TMC MLAs  should  also 
resign  because  Mr. Chokkar was forced to resign  owing  to  the 
stand taken by the party. The TMC president, Mr. G. K.  Moopanar, 
had  no courage to field candidates and he had pawned  the  self-
respect  of his party to Ms. J. Jayalalitha, the AIADMK  supremo, 
said Dr. Ramadoss said.

He  urged the Central Government to allot adequate fund  for  the 
implementation  of Sethu-Samudram project in the  coming  budget. 
Moreover, the PMK won't hesitate to raise voice in Parliament  on 
retrieving  Kutch  island  from Sri  Lankan  Government  for  the 
benefit of the fishermen in the coastal villages of the State.

The PMK had also planned to organise `communal-religious harmony' 
conferences  in  the southern districts with the  aim  to  ensure 
brotherliness  between dalits and other dominant  communities  in 
the southern part of the State.

The   party   had  decided  to  organise   such   conference   in 
Ramanathapuram within two months.

Mr.  Ramadoss  urged  the Government  to  declare  Ramanathapuram 
district  as  the drought-hit area. The  Government  should  take 
necessary steps to contain water scarcity on war-footing  because 
the  entire  district  was reeling  under  acute  drinking  water 
shortage, he added.
