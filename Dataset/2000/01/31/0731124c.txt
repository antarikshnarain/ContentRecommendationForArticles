India claims 50m gold


KUALA LUMPUR, JAN. 30. India won the team gold in the women's 50-
metre sport rifle prone event in the Asian shooting  championship 
here   on  Saturday,  with  Anjali  Vedpathak  also  winning   an 
individual silver.

Anjali, Kuheli Gangulee and Roopa Unnikrishnan shot 1,749  points 
to pip Uzbekistan to the gold medal by just one point. Japan  won 
the bronze with 1,740 points.

In the individual final, Anjali was beaten to the gold by Japan's 
Yoko Minamoto. Alyona Aksyonova of Uzbekistan took the bronze.

Chinese  women,  however,  took  the  spotlight  with  two  world 
records.  Zhang  Yanli snatched the individual gold  in  a  world 
record  of 381 points and then partnered Zhang Yi and Qiu Wei  to 
clinch the team gold, also with a world mark.

Yi  took  the  individual  silver with  380  points,  which  also 
surpassed the previous world record of 376 set in 1998 by Natalya 
Kovalenko of Kazakhstan.

Their  team score of 1,127 shattered the world mark of 1,119  set 
in  1998, and was 490 points more than that of  silver  medallist 
Japan represented by Kumiko Tanabe, Ai Watanabe and Mai Watanabe.

Tournament  Assistant  Technical Director Jasni Shaari  said  the 
records might not be ratified by the world shooting body  because 
the events did not have the required participation. International 
regulations  state  that  every event must  have  at  least  five 
entries  for  records  to be  recognised.  The  women's  10-meter 
running target individual event had four shooters while the  team 
event featured only two countries.
