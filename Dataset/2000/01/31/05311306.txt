Ban strikes


Sir, - At a critical time when our borders were threatened by the 
enemies  who  united  to form a  Pakistan-China  axis,  the  all-
powerful  unions of the Electricity department in Uttar  Pradesh, 
dock  workers and also doctors in Andhra Pradesh went  on  strike 
demanding their pound of flesh. It is a shame that  opportunistic 
political  parties are encouraging these unions which are  taking 
the  people for a ride. An ordinance must be passed  to  prohibit 
all strikes for five years.

Sir, - The Government has accepted almost all the demands of  the 
port  and  dock workers. It has also been agreed ``to  treat  the 
strike  period  as leave due to the employees or the  leave  that 
would  accrue to them in future.'' The workers are in a  jubilant 
mood  but  the five-day strike has caused the nation  a  loss  of 
about  Rs. 3,000 crores. This heavy loss could have been  averted 
had the Government initiated negotiations earlier.
