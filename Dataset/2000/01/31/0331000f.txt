Contentious Bangla 'safety' law passed


DHAKA,  JAN.  30. The Bangladesh Parliament today  passed  a  new 
controversial law aimed at curbing terrorist activities and other 
crimes,  even as the main Opposition alliance gave a call  for  a 
nationwide strike against it.

The  Public Safety (Special Provision) Bill-2000 was  adopted  by 
voice-vote, after several amendments. It includes provisions  for 
special  tribunals to deal with serious offences including  arson 
and bombings, damaging of vehicles, public and private  property, 
extortion,  and  hijacking. Importantly, the  bill  limits  trial 
periods  to  90 days from the date of arrest in  such  cases.  In 
addition, the accused offender will not be given bail during  his 
trial.

The new law stipulates a maximum 14 years in jail for a convict.

The  introduction  of  the  bill  came  amid  fervent  Opposition 
criticism that the new legislation could well be used to  repress 
political opponents by the government in power.

The  Opposition decision to declare a strike this week was  taken 
by  the  leaders  of  the four-party  alliance  in  an  overnight 
meeting.

``The  government is enacting the new law to cling to  power  and 
interfere  in  the Judiciary,'' said Mr.  Abdul  Mannan  Bhuiyan, 
Secretary  General of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.  He  said 
the  existing law can check terrorism and maintain law and  order 
if  used properly and ``neutrally.'' Bangladeshi Prime  Minister, 
Ms. Sheikh Hasina has rejected the Opposition charges.
