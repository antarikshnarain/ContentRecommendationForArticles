Inflation rises to 3.31 p.c.


NEW  DELHI, JAN. 30. The annual inflation moved steadily  upwards 
to a 32-week high of 3.31 per cent for the week ended January 15, 
despite the Wholesale Price Index remaining unchanged.

Inflation rate had touched the previous high of 3.53 per cent for 
the  week ended June 5, 1999. The 0.20 percentage points rise  in 
the inflation rate to 3.31 per cent (provisional) as against 3.11 
per cent (provisional) in the previous week was mainly on account 
of  the  rise in select indices under the  manufactured  products 
category.
