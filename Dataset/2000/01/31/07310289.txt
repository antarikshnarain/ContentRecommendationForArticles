Azhar not popular with players, says Kapil Dev


PERTH, JAN. 30. Mohammad Azharuddin, who did not find a place  in 
the  Indian  cricket team now in Australia, is not  very  popular 
among the players, according to coach Kapil Dev.

Asked  about  reports that he and skipper  Sachin  Tendulkar  had 
opposed  the former India captain's inclusion in the team,  Kapil 
Dev  told  PTI  here  on Saturday, ``there  will  always  be  two 
opinions on the same thing.''

After  taking over as coach, Kapil Dev said ``when I walked  into 
the Indian dressing room, I was really surprised for someone  who 
has  played  cricket for so long and captained the  team  for  10 
years, Azhar was not a very popular player in the team.''

``I was really surprised with that,'' the coach added. 

Azhar takes exception

Our Sports Reporter adds from Pune: Mohammad Azharuddin expressed 
surprise  at Kapil Dev's statement about him being ``not  popular 
in the Indian dressing room''.

``I  think  the Board should look into the matter. As  far  as  I 
know,  there has never been a problem and I do not know  what  he 
(Kapil) is talking about,'' said Azharuddin matter-of- factly.

``If he really means what he has said, he should substantiate  it 
with  facts. Let the Board ask him and also other  players  about 
how the atmosphere was spoilt, directly or indirectly, by me.  If 
there is any truth in the matter let it come out in the open, and 
if  there isn't any, Kapil should be told not to indulge in  such 
loose  talk,''  said  Azharuddin,  the  most  successful   Indian 
captain. The Hyderabad player, leading South Zone in the  Deodhar 
Trophy  in  his  bid for a comeback, added  that  he  had  always 
believed in giving chances to others, and he was never the one to 
feel threatened.

He  also  hinted that the atmosphere in the dressing  room  would 
depend on how the team was faring.
